  "quotes": [
    "It's so much better to finally get a grasp on this stuff after years of feeling like having these feelings and not being able to understand where they were coming from.",
    "You can't rush something like that; all that's gonna do is make it harder to get to a place where you want to be emotionally.",
    "Just because we're not consciously thinking about something doesn't mean that we aren't assessing the world around us.",
    "I think it's okay because you fit in all these other places. Maybe you fit there.",
    "You have to realize that the way you're living is an option.",
    "Being able to recognize that feelings can be painful but also necessary is so powerful.",
    "You can't ever truly be altruistic unless you're egoistic to a certain extent.",
    "You will forget. It's not the arrangement to do; that's what a computer is meant to do.",
    "It takes time to mature, to understand how you're feeling, and let those feelings marinate.",
    "You will never be able to be empathetic towards yourself if you don't give other people the same empathy."
