    "You can tell me anything. That's what friends are for.",
    "If you can make a podcast that people will sit and listen to for over an hour, that's huge.",
    "The best way to learn is by doing.",
    "If you spend so much time making something, you can't even watch it with people who are supporting you? That's ridiculous.",
    "Why can't I just call myself a filmmaker? I am one.",
    "You should not do that, but if you're making something and putting yourself out there, that's much more than a guilty conscience.",
    "Your voice is the most unique thing you can write.",
    "Make that podcast, make that song; regardless of whether or not that ends up being your passion, you will definitely learn something about yourself.",
    "A passion isn't something you have; a passion is something that develops through practice.",
    "Enjoy the journey, not just the destination."
