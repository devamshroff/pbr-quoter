  "quotes": [
    "You are loved solely where you may show weakness without provoking the strength.",
    "I always wait too long to do every single thing.",
    "If you don't accept your own pain, that's just going to prevent you from expressing them and dealing with them in a healthy way.",
    "Life can only be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards.",
    "Sometimes I'll just cry for like hours, and afterwards I try not to respond to that anymore by saying like, 'Oh, you need to be stronger.'",
    "You can't heal everybody; you can't please everybody.",
    "The body can be in pain, and we accept that, but when the mind's in pain, we see it as a personal failing.",
    "What I've been moving towards is a realization of accepting multiple truths.",
    "You have to trust yourself to perceive things as they are.",
    "The hardest part of growth is allowing yourself to be weak."
