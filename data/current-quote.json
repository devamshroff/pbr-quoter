    "You realize who I am, right? I'm you.",
    "Procrastination is not an issue about being lazy or just not wanting to do something; it's fundamentally an emotional regulation issue.",

    "Wiggle your toe. Sometimes just a small movement can spark a larger action.",
    "Make yourself uncomfortable. Open up your social circle and talk to people you haven't talked to before.",
    "It’s okay to feel like you don’t belong in a space; just be honest about it and you’ll find support.",
    "When you like something, you feel like you're in a good mood, and maybe you find that this is something you want to study.",
    "Your inner voice should be soft; it should remind you that you are trying your hardest.",
    "Trust the process and trust yourself to follow through.",
    "Don't be afraid to call warm lines or reach out for help; those resources are there for you."
