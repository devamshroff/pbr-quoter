  "quotes": [
    "You need to understand who you are and accept that in order to even know what you're truly capable of.",
    "I always wait too long to do every single thing.",
    "Life can only be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards.",
    "I was so focused on living the life that I should that it blinded me from understanding who I really was.",
    "You can't control how people see you; you need to trust the people who are right for you to accept you as you are.",
    "You can run from your pain, but that doesn't mean that they'll go away.",
    "It's okay to feel weak; it's okay to sit with your emotions and acknowledge them.",
    "Sometimes you just have to let your heart break you so you can really start again.",
    "The desire to help everyone can lead to judgment and can be poisonous.",
    "I learned how to exist, how to breathe, and everything else comes after that."
