  "quotes": [
    "You are loved solely where you may show weakness without provoking the strength.",
    "I always wait too long to do every single thing.",
    "Sometimes I'll just cry for hours, and afterwards, I try not to respond to that by saying, 'Oh, you need to be stronger.'",
    "The body can feel pain without judgment; the mind should be allowed the same grace.",
    "You can't please everyone; you need to trust the people who are right for you to accept you as you are.",
    "Life can only be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards.",
    "It's easy to define what's right for someone else but much harder to do so for yourself.",
    "You can run from your pain, but that doesn’t mean it will go away.",
    "I was trying my best and sometimes that just isn’t good enough, and that’s just life.",
    "Accepting your pain is a powerful step towards growth."
