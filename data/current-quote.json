    "You realize how many times you failed a test this past year? You're a freshman in college. People don't fail shit like that.",
    "It's not about the words, it's about the fact that you even try.",
    "Sometimes you just need to wiggle your toe.",
    "Motivation isn’t going to strike you; you have to make it happen.",
    "Procrastination is not an issue about being lazy; it's an emotional regulation issue.",

    "If you can get yourself out of bed today, that's a win.",
    "The biggest way to approach this is based off of what sounds interesting to you.",
