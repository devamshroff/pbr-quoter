 This poem was written and performed by Munir Niyazi. I translated it to English, but I can't do the original justice. So I'm adding the original clip at the end of the episode. I always wait too long to do everything. When there's something important to say, when there's a promise to keep, to call for her, to ask for her back, I always wait too long. To help someone, to hold my grieving friend close, to travel all roads to meet someone, I always wait too long. To fall in love with the journey of changing seasons, to keep someone in mind, to forget someone, I always wait too long. To save them from grief before death, reality was something different, to go tell her that. I always wait too long to do every single thing. I always wait too long. I always wait too long to do every single thing. Good evening everyone. Welcome to the day view grand opening of pineapple plant rotation season 2.

I know it's been a long break since the last time, so thank you for your patience, thank you for bringing with us. If this is your first time joining us, we are a podcast aimed at sharing experiences from our lives and starting conversations about different problems we face in our 20s or that just go unnoticed. We just don't talk about it enough. It's been a weird few months, right? Oh god. One of the weirdest few months of my entire life. Yeah, so many weirds. Just like personally, politically, like everything. I've heard the word terrif more than I've ever wanted to hear in my entire life. Yeah, what the fuck? I feel like I'm numb to the news now. Like it doesn't even matter. Like every day just feels like a different like circus act going on. Yeah. I don't even have it anymore. Like emotionally, you're react. It's just like. Oh, god. I feel like the word realism has less meaning. Yes, especially with eating on. What the hell is this man? I don't understand. I haven't seen anyone knows, including that man. I just take Elon Musk, Kanye and Trump. If you just focus on those three people, it makes you question everything you know about reality. Oh god. I feel like I've just like stopped paying attention to Kanye at this point. I just can't do it anymore. Did you see his stuff about Elon stealing his Nazi swag? I was like, I was a Nazi before it was cool. Yeah, I really don't understand sometimes. But the question becomes like how do we orient ourselves in a way that I mean one approach, which is like I feel like a lot of people have done, especially a lot of people who are left leaning and just kind of shut down. Yeah. You know, and just stopped caring or thinking about anything. Yeah. And it definitely comes from a place of privilege where a lot of the problems that are coming up don't really directly impact us. Like for me personally, I don't think anything that's happened in the last few months are going to make my day to day life that much different. Right. So it's easy to be able to just kind of block it all out and pretend it's not happening. I mean, I think it's like partially like yeah, we are obviously like insulated for a certain extent because of our privilege. I do think there's an element of denial because like I think for now we're insulated, but I think if like shit really gets bad, it's like. Like we really have like white supremacists in the white house, right? Like that like there is only so long we will be insulated for that if like things get as bad as they seem like they're going to get. But I do think there is another aspect where it's also just like what the fuck do you even do, right? Like what can be actually like realistically do to change that right now when like all the lever levels of power control by these people right and like. I was actually talking to Karthik about this earlier where in Russia like as like democracy started like faltering there was this idea of like people living in exile at home. So it was like for intellectuals and like people like that. They sort of disengaged with politics because there was nothing they could do about it and just focused on like art and focused on their families and like focus on these spaces where they still could express themselves freely and things like that. So I almost feel like we're sort of moving towards that point where like as a mixture of all of these things like people are just sort of like hunkering down and trying to find like the comfort and freedom that they can. Can like where they still can you know that makes a lot of sense actually that's feel like yeah you're right we're moving in that direction. Yeah, but I guess what we can do is just keep being true to whatever it is that you know we believe in right and just helping our communities being kind to people. Yeah doing what's within our control on a smaller scale you know like on a local scale around us that's all we can do preserving human language or we can. And obviously like obviously we need the world needs radical people right like change does not mean without radical people ever. Yeah, but at the same time we can expect people to take on that role but what you can do is focus on your own communities. Yeah and like in terms of like politically like what is an accessory like I mean I have a lot of thoughts on this like like as someone who's like very like mental like politics and like things a lot about like what would be necessary to like fix things. I really think there is a lot of effort needed on like the local scale to like build up new institutions and like organizations to like really challenge what is happening politically to. So yeah I mean it's like a mixture of everything it's a mixture of needing to like just preserve like the humanity we can to preserve our communities and like just support ourselves on the local level. The one good thing is like the the United States is pretty like federalized right the local level especially in like blue states and stuff will be pretty secure. So we need to make sure culturally and like politically we're preserving what we can here and also like that process of like build even larger political change will take like a long time of like building up like organizations and stuff. So I do think there is some hope there and like I do think there are like paths forward for like how we can change things but yeah I mean there's only so much we can do and I think it's a very slow very like time consuming painful process. So yeah I want to I want to clarify like the issue is not that the current government is conservative or red right like that is far from what the issue is. Yeah I mean yes obviously like as a person who is leaning left like you want to see more it just feel a bit regressive when we talk about things like literally like about abortion right like let's say like abortion stances or you know stances on how our money should be used in the government whether we should spend more on defense like whether you know all of these things like taxes right we're not talking about any of those things right. Yeah those things I understand can come from different ideal ideology like whatever it's just the way things are run right now like every day the new headlines are here just like crazier than the last you know like it's like oh I want to buy Greenland oh can I become a state. Oh like just the most fucking like random like unhinged things you can think of yeah it's no longer about like like it's not even about like political differences it's just about sanity. Yeah it's like we're trying to pressure Ukraine into giving us all of their natural resources in exchange for our support. Not even that we're not even guaranteeing anything Trump is literally like give us 50% of the actual resources why and the way they're doing it like it like there was no talks of this they just showed up with that document. Yes after negotiation. Yes. And just trying to pressure him and assigning it. What do you mean bro like we're just playing a bully at this point. That's literally what it is like Trump literally said like oh I'm tired of people telling me about Putin's war crimes like like Ukraine has no like cards that they hold which yeah no shit because like literally got invaded right. We're just trying right now but that's all he gives a fuck about what's in it for him. Anyways we should move on. Yeah. And we got to get it up. It's just like what kind of world do you want your kids to grow up in right. Yeah. Like these are the leaders that they're looking up to and modeling themselves after right. Yeah. Do you want your kids to see the highest man in power cry when he loses an election and tries to overthrow the whole fucking government and throw a tantrum. Or do you want someone who you know can gracefully accept that they lost you know it's like yeah. It's like the most simple human thing that you want in a person right. Yeah. Yeah. Like not even like just losing an election like the highest person in power literally like being convicted of rape in civil court. Yeah. Like that's why I say it's not about like political differences to me. But it's just about like humanity. Like what kind of world like the character of these people what kind of world we're creating for like the future generations like you. Yeah. Do you want a rapist leading your country? Yes. Like that's literally what it comes down to right. Anyways it's also been interesting. It's been a period of transition you know. Yeah. Obviously politically like we just talked about but like also I mean in my personal life I think. And you too right here but. Oh yeah. The crazy thing is I feel like we're always transitioning from one place to another rate like that's how like the sum with the sum of it which becomes life. Just the rate at which you're transitioning the rate of change. Right. The rate of change changes there enough. So I hear what's going on. Do you want to go first before I go into a full ass rap? I feel like I have a lot to talk about here. I've been as I kind of mentioned I've been in an interesting period of transition like I am finally done with a lot of my traveling that I've been doing. You know, hopping around place to place. Literally like feeling like I was living out of suitcase for so long. And while really great experiences met a lot of really cool people. In a lot of really you know a lot of interesting places. I am very much ready to build something in one place. You know some very thankful that I was able to move back to the city back to New York. I mean I move into my apartment set it up start routines. I think that's the key difference like I'm building my life around routines. Which I wasn't before and I feel a difference. That's what it's been about for me at least being patient as I set up those routines because they don't form overnight. And you can only really do one thing at a time. So it's very easy to get frustrated and blow it all up. Like you have to hold it together for a while. Also enjoying yourself. You know, not just about patients. Not obsessing over giving it right the first time getting perfect. You know just. Yeah. But yeah, that's been that's been a cool process for sure. All right. I'll let you go into your rant now. Yeah. I mean, I feel like I am in a pretty similar place, but through a very long and like circuit you it is pathway. So I ended up breaking things off with my ex who I've been with for almost seven years at that point. So that like I've really just been dealing with the fallout from that and like just processing everything that came out of that. And extremely long and extremely painful process because I think at this point. I mean, I don't I don't want to say anything for her. Like there was room to grow for both of us. And so I've really just been focused on carrying forward the lessons from that. Like working on myself. Like working on like understanding why I did certain things that I'm not particularly proud of. Just understanding like why I found it so hard to deal with that situation in like the most healthy way and really yeah. Just like trying to own up to and carry forward a lot of those lessons that I've learned through that experience. So yeah, after things ended between us, I move I've been I moved into a new place. Like I have a really nice setup like I've been like getting a lot into interior design. Like it's always something that I wanted to do, but I feel like for the first time. I'm actually executing their life. I've had in mind. I very focused on like building up my life again on my own focusing a lot on like what you said, like just building up routine and structure, just like those fundamentals. Yeah, because I feel like I sort of lived in like a very disorganized way before like I sort of dealt with things like moment to moment like dealt with things like more immediately based on my emotional reaction. And things like that and I've really been focused on like building up structure building up stability in a way that I've never really had before in my life. So that's been really amazing and exciting because yeah, I just feel like I have a level of consistency and like clarity about my life and myself that I didn't have before. And yeah, like very focused on like learning, like growing, like working on myself. And yeah, just like getting more in touch with myself, like what I want for my life, what I'm capable of, like what I need. And yeah, like like I said, like getting more in touch with myself and like my own identities, like I've been experimenting a lot with like a lot of different things. I got the full crash out treatment, so I got bang and my ears pierced. I got nice. Yeah, I got it looks good. I know I've been. I've been thinking right now my hair is a little trash, but in general, like I've been aiming to like grow my hair for a while and I really think it suits me. Yeah, I've been. I got like a ukulele, so I've been like practicing that a little bit. I've been getting more into hobbies like photography and stuff. Like I said, like interior decorating and design, like that's like a good way for me to like keep in touch with like sort of like my artistic impulses, like writing more. Doing things like that. And like I said, I find a lot of like satisfaction in just like those like everyday activities that I really didn't before. Like I feel like before I used to see things as like meal prepping and like, yeah, things like that as like obligations. And I've really been trying to focus on seeing them more as things I can find like peace and like comfort in like just relating to my own life and like the fundamental building box of my life in a more healthy way that I can find like comfort and satisfaction. So yeah, I mean pretty much my entire life like it's like pretty pretty like is transforming a lot and there's been a lot of like growing pains along with that. I'm gonna say it's been easy. I mean there are a lot of like even now like every week like I spent a couple of hours like just crying about everything that's happened like about the breakup just about yeah like just coming to terms of things about myself. There's a lot of pain that comes with that, but I think I know I'm on the right path. I know that there's a lot of growth that I'm very happy about and that I've been wanting for a long time. Even now the problems that I'm like dealing with and that I'm working on were always there. It was just that in the past. I didn't really give myself the mental space and like the bandwidth to deal with them and I know as I'm working on them I'm getting to a much happier place even I'm not necessarily the happiest all the time now. So it's been a long very eventful, but very like very painful but very satisfying process. Yeah, that's a lot. That's the why is this so traumatic part of our break up? I mean that's kind of like that's almost like the game that you make right it's like you're integrating your life like so deeply with someone because you care about them, but at the same time if things don't work out it's almost like losing a part of yourself. Especially when you're in a rebuild mode, you know like I feel like this is around the time where you really want to get your life together and focus on things that you just didn't have the bandwidth for before or you were ignoring or you know whatever maybe let the heart break break you, you know, so that you can really really start again and that process is hard and long and but I feel like what comes out of it is so beautiful. And like oh yeah I'm so much more at peace with my life literally just the way I live my life, you know that I won't say it's worth it but because it's fucking terrible but maybe almost worth it to go through that right. No, I got you. Yeah when you're in a relationship because you have so much invested in that it's like yeah like it's difficult always to like see yourself and like what you really need clearly because you're so afraid of like that loss. Yeah, it's just hard to center yourself when you're almost incorporating someone into yourself and your life in that level. And it's inevitable right like I mean you you build your life around your needs and the other person's needs and because like if you get together at a young age and maybe you don't have a maybe you don't have a kind of sense of self and they don't have one you kind of build around each other's needs and a lot get ignored a lot get ignored. It almost feels like it's necessary to go through this process but I don't want to say that because at the same time you I see I see some other couples in my life that have been together for so long and very happy and you know they're on their way to get married and it's a beautiful beautiful thing so I guess everyone's journey is different right. So 100%. It's almost like what you're saying about how like you have to center your needs and center the other person's needs it's like it no longer becomes about like you and the other person right it becomes about our needs like us together and so that can lead to a lot of confusion about like what do I actually need as a person like what am I really comfortable like giving up and like what what is feasible for my own life. And I think like like you're saying like for some people like it works out like they know like they're part them and their partner happen to click together like maybe they have just a lot of clarity about like what they need from their own life so that ends up working out but I think for a lot of people like that's why early relationships don't end up working out is because that's not like an easy thing to figure out what you really need like especially when you're so young and like I mean experience is the best teacher right like sometimes yeah. You can't you can't know what you need until you're at that point where you like when you come through that pain and like you really realize like okay like I can't give this up like I really do need this. Yeah and at the same time I feel like on the other side you know because I after my last breakup a big theme in my life has been how can I keep my heart open as open as I can while being grounded in myself. That's been a cool interesting scary process when you when you put your heart on the line like that for the first time it's like and it doesn't work out like how do you trust yourself to know like when the right time is again like how do you know like when you're yeah yeah I definitely know what you mean. We're not going to do a we're not that's not that the so we're doing today. For but honestly guys like this is your first time listening to us like everything in the last five minutes maybe 10 minutes. If you heard all that you can skip the breakups episode. Summary you can be about three and a half hours worth of content. No you're doing it wrong but you have to tell people if you're more interested in hearing about this. Oh my bad my bad yeah you got to plug this shit. Yeah it's not like we're making any money on this. I'll start plugging back up. I'll start plugging back to previous episodes when we stay being able to monetize view. Can tell them I'll spare the people. So here so coming back to you know obviously like this period has been fucking insane in terms of the amount of change like that is happening right in your life. Like what are kind of some of the things that you're focusing on in terms of how you're living your life you know day to day how you're interacting with yourself like whatever whatever it may be like where is the biggest change coming from. It's hard to I guess like pick one thing is the biggest but I guess like if I had to start somewhere it's really on like self judgment and like giving up a lot of self judgment in order to see myself clearly. Because like I think in the past like I was so focused on living the life that I should on like judging everything I was doing making sure I was doing the right thing making sure I was seeing things in the right way that I had the right beliefs that I had the right perspective. That that really blinded me from understanding who I really was because that self judgment like kept me from being honest because I had so much emotionally attached like to those judgments and to those self evaluations. So really I feel like now that like I'm on my own like I've really just been focused on seeing myself clearly seeing the world clearly seeing things around me clearly like I thought understanding the world was like seeing things in the right way and having the right beliefs reverses like really just trusting myself to like perceive things as they are. And like to a certain extent like that's very connected to like being present just like being mindful and like letting things be what they are as instead of like trying to forcefully to like determine them. And I think like that is very related to like a lot of the stuff that we were talking about. I think like when we were talking about like breakups and like like seeing yourself and your needs clearly like I think like the reason what makes that so hard is because like you sort of have so many ideas for your relationship you have so many ideas for me you should be in like the context of like the life that you should have based on those things that it really prevents you from being honest with yourself about who you are and like what you really want to do. I'm like what you really need because you have so much emotionally invested in those things and so yeah I've really just been focused on letting me myself be what I am and seeing that for what it is regardless of like how painful or how hard for how scary or how like yeah just like how bad I may make you all about that in the moment. When you say like when you say seeing the world for what it really is like what does that mean like can you give an example of that. Like I guess a good example like a simple example is sort of if someone's like telling me about their life or they're just telling me about something that's been happening in their day I feel like I was so focused on like how do I seem to this person like am I saying the right thing am I saying something am I saying the right thing to make them feel better like how are they going to perceive like me and what I'm doing like should I say like what I have to do. I say like what I have in mind I was so focused on my own judgment that things I was saying what that meant about me how that person would see me that it provided me from fully understanding like the impact that my words would have on other people and also from fully understanding like how they really felt about me because when you're so focused on your own self perception about like whether how you seem to the world whether you're doing the right thing like when you're so focused on that. When you're so focused on your own occupations of your anxiety and stuff like that projection of your own self perception can end up overriding like the reality of how the other person feels about you and what they think about you of what your words are doing to them. And so like in order to fully you can't really understand what someone needs and like the effect you're having on them unless you're able to let go of your own like fear in your own self judgment and allow yourself to clearly understand like what they're thinking about you instead of like allowing your own emotional response and those projections to like cloud your vision if that makes sense. Yeah, I think basically what you're saying is like we create these like beard extractions right just we're just talking about communication like conversation with someone like we create all these abstractions on top of the reality of what's happening which is just you are expressing something to someone else right there expressing something to you but we create these abstractions on top of it which is just like am I seeing the right thing. Yeah, so that that person puts me in a certain light you know takes it a certain way so that you seem amicable you seem knowledgeable you seem nice you give them exactly what they need so they feel better like all of these things and really you just want them to like you right like yes like comes from a insecurity whether this person likes you or not. And the way we combat it is we add all these games on top of it right there's all these YouTube videos and and contasters and you know how to communicate like what to say things to say to get people to respect you like you yeah how to win a conversation how to get what you want you know when really if you strip everything away and you just be yourself yeah that's the purest way to communicate with someone right and you have to be like you know what you want to say. And you have to know and be at peace with the fact that they might not be ready to receive your energy whatever it is you want to say or whatever it is that you're saying and that comes from their own preoccupations and yeah predispositions about where they are in their life you know how to are they to themselves they could be the kindest person on the planet but they might not be ready to hear what you have to say or maybe your energies don't match. I think what it is we're so scared of rejection yeah that we create all these abstractions to make sure that we're like yeah and it really ends up hurting us yeah yeah definitely it's about letting the be moment be what it is as opposed to trying to control the moment and make it into something and like like you're saying like I do think it is fundamentally out of the place of like insecurity and wanting to control control how people react to you like control the how people see you control like what they put in the world. Think of you when like the reality is like you can't please everyone right you need to trust the people who are right for you to like accept you as you are. Yeah like you can't control how people see you see you you can't control how they're going to feel about what you say and like all that trying to control that is going to do is going to exhaust you is going to like prevent you from having confidence in yourself because you can't trust your own natural instincts like you're going to be so focused on like trying to. Like you're going to be focused on like trying to like over analyze like every single moment and yeah you're going to take every situation where like someone isn't ready to listen to you or isn't like willing to like you like you're going to take that like as a personal like reflection of like your value as a person and like not to understand like you're not going to be able to maintain that perspective of like okay like this person maybe this person just doesn't gel with me like maybe this person just isn't in the right place right now. Like listen to what I'm saying but I have to trust that I'm doing my best and like I'm being true to myself and that I can only like I have to be okay with like what is within my control like and this is again like very related to like a big thing I've been thinking about which is the ego like and like accepting our limitations as like people because I think like fundamentally it comes from like a place of anxiety about like our life. It's like a place of anxiety about like our limitations about the fact that we can't control all of those things and so we desperately try to cling to the illusion of control even though all cling to that illusion does is make us more unhappy. Some people get really good at playing that game you know but really like you've got to ask yourself like is that the life you want to live where you're constantly playing a game trying to get people to like you. You're good at it like that's not the life you want to live like. There's no peace in that like especially when it comes to like dating like so many guys they obsess over the right thing to say. Yeah. They're playing a game basically and it's like if you learn how to express yourself and be confident in that expression that you will find someone that matches your energy. I promise you that. But you have to learn you have to do the hard part to learn how to express yourself first as someone like like right now like I feel like I can I'm like very likeable to like anyone like I can just like make casual conversation yeah I'm just generally like pretty likeable but the fact that I got to that point where people like me didn't actually make me feel any better about myself. I'm just like a reflection of my own insecurity I needed to be like by anyone and then even though I got like very good at it and like most people did like me all I would fixate on was that tiny percentage of people who didn't. I feel like really what I've been moving towards is like a realization of yeah like I genuinely do enjoy like talking to most people and I do enjoy learning about their lives understanding like I enjoy like contributing to people's lives through my conversation being able to like be an enjoyable person to other people. But at the same time I need to accept the fact that like I can only do so much that there are always going to be people who don't accept me and I can't focus on making sure people like me I need to focus on my own enjoyment and my own satisfaction in that process. Otherwise like yeah like it's just going to intensify the anxiety it's going to intensify like my own like feeling that I can't have trust insecurity on myself as a person if I don't constantly like think manage how I'm interacting with people they're not going to be there for me. It's a process stripping that a little bit away being able to clearly differentiate between when am I talking to this person because I'm actually enjoying the conversation versus when am I talking to this person because I feel like I need to be like a boy and I feel like I need to be on you know like I feel like even being honest with yourself about that can like be very hard when you have a lot of self-judgment and when you have so much of your you know invest in all this. It's hard to break out of any stream of thought that we have because we identify with it right that's who we are that is the voice right that is our voice. So I think some of these concepts come from right like about separating yourself from that thinking about all your thoughts as clouds right which is like new one of the most simplest techniques that you learn in whether it's therapy whether it's Buddhism imagining that you're the sky and not the clouds in it not the storm that's going on whatever it might be right that's been an interesting image to default back to but I think recently I've been kind of growing a little deeper on it and I think I'm going to be like I'm trying to be the first one to see what I'm going to do. I'm going to be a little deeper on it and I came across this something called like observer theory kind of phrase that I don't know if you've heard this before like the observer is the observed. I've heard that phrase but I can't remember what it means. Okay. Yeah, honestly I can't tell you exactly what it means like I think I'm also like trying to grasp it myself but basically this idea that like you know your stream of consciousness or I want to call it like the inner commentator is the one that I'm going to say. There is the one that you hear on a day-to-day basis that's the one those are all of your thoughts that voice that criticizes you that reassures you that tells you what to do. Yeah, you know is deciding between two things like that's that voice right so that's that's one part but then the other part of you is just the observer. The observer doesn't say it right like it's just is does that make sense like it's just it's awareness right like it's yeah. It's the part of you that you kind of get a glimpse of when you meditate for a really long time or you do acid or shrooms you know like this is what it does like it really it takes you back into just existence where you can see those streams of thought that you have and realize that those are changeable like those are those are malleable like you can change that you can change how that voice interacts with your mind. It's like that voice interacts with your self how you have that voice interacts with the world with other people and once you realize that and start making those changes I feel like that's when for me at least like that's when a lot of positive changes have happened in my life. I don't even want to talk about that phrase anymore because that's such an abstract phrase like basically what it's trying to say is like that observer is every it's the same observer that is looking at you and is looking at everyone else and is looking at the world. It's it's just the feeling of existence right just a pure feeling of existence to be able to just feel that is life changing. That's what I'm getting at when I talk about like judgment first of all just seeing and like observing is because it's like when we observe something we're almost immediately have judgments and like determinations about it right like about oh like what is this thing like how should it be how should I react to it and just realizing that like you don't know what I'm doing. That like you don't have to go along with that part of yourself that is making these judgments there is a part of you behind that that is like seeing that thought in judgment and can like choose whether or not it wants to like go along with that can choose to like you to be more removed. It's not even about like making a different choice right it's just about seeing it in the first place right and not not choosing not to engage with it just noticing it that's it. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, you know, I think I get what it is because basically the ways or brains work like we see something that we've seen before and we immediately have dozens of thoughts about it based on our own predispositions like and all these rules that you have come out this practice that I've been trying to do recently where it's like every time I see something a person or a thing or whatever or a conversation like like can I pretend like it's the first time. I'm seeing it and then really just sitting with that and trying to grasp what it is breaking free from a lot of those rules and predispositions that have had. Yeah, I don't even know where I'm going with this. I mean, I just feel like this is one of those things that I haven't fully grasped but it's very interesting to me. I have a very interesting way of thinking about this. I'm curious what you think. Like the best example I can give is like say you're like at home and then you realize like, oh, I should do my laundry and you go to do your laundry. And suppose like someone else asked you like, oh, like, why did you go like, why did you decide to do your laundry right now? And you might give a lot of different. You might say like, oh, like I noticed a lot of clothes piling up and so that was making me uncomfortable and so like I decided, oh, like I really had to get rid of all this clutter and like go do my laundry. And so we often like we often associate with that thought process and like the reasons we give for the things that we do. But the thing is that someone else in the same situation, they might give like different reasons for doing the same thing or they may not just think of it at all. Even if you think about doing something, you have no control over whether or not you thought about that thing in the first place. We can give all the reasons I want you want, even if you have those reasons, you may not like think of whatever you're thinking of realizing how unconscious like thought and like all of our behavior fundamentally is that like even if you have a reasons for doing a thing like that doesn't mean that you're actually going to think it or do it. That really helps me like have some remove that is the illusion right. I think I partially agree with that. I think on a local level, you're right, you don't have control over your thoughts. Like if you're sitting there lying in bed like you, you don't have no control over what is going through your head right at that point. Like say you can't sleep for whatever reason. There's just a flood of thoughts that keep you keep getting caught in. The only thing you can do is really step back and notice those thoughts right. Even thinking that I should step back and notice these thoughts is not something that you have control over right. Like that's something whether or not you even think to do that in the first place is just spontaneous right. No, but see that's where I disagree right like you're right that on a local level we don't have control. But the reason we don't have control is because we have all these like data points from before or lack of data points. I should say where we do remember to have to do the laundry or I have to I have to take a step back and observe my thoughts right like that comes from you doing it once or twice right like yeah yeah like habit and routine like adding those data points to your unconscious basically right because that's where like unconscious thought isn't. They're not it's not pulling out of nowhere right like it's it's pulling out of your own life experiences and things you've registered in your brain. So you can you have control over your thoughts on a long term scale. Yeah. So if you practice positive thinking every time you talk to yourself in a negative way you catch yourself you corrected and you will eventually change how you think. And the things that you think about I disagree with the statement that you don't have no control over your thoughts is what I'm trying to say yeah yeah I mean I agree like I guess like what I'm trying to get at is like the distance you have where it's like we identify with like our conscious thoughts like whatever that pops up when in reality that observer like is the unconscious is like the thing that's behind that which is producing that those thoughts in the first place. And we apply so much judgment to like the particular thoughts that we have in the moment when in reality like where we have the control is in like that overall structure which causes like certain thoughts to pop up or not like we judge ourselves for like not thinking of something or for like the particular judgments we have or like we identify like with what we decide to do in the moment when in reality like what we should be identifying with is that thing behind it. That's like observing those thoughts and that we can influence and wander. Yeah. I think it's very powerful to identify with the observer but you also have to like go that you know otherwise you wouldn't be able to live your daily life like that's how people get dissociated right. Yeah. I don't even know how to think about that. It's just I mean the way I usually think about it is that like in the moment I just have to like trust like what I'm doing like spontaneously like what I think is like I'm doing. I'm glad to be speaking briefly like what I think of like how I decide to act. And then in afterwards like I can sort of reflect on that and like see where that came from like unconsciously and like what was really driving that behavior and try to influence it but in the moment if you try and like think about Oh like what unconsciously is causing that what in my past is really causing me to feel this way you're going to get trapped. self-reflection and like not be able to engage it in life like effect of right. One of my favorite quotes is life can only be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards. Like you have to trust yourself and like what you decide to do spontaneously and you have to reflect on that afterwards. If you overthink it like you're like you can't do that. You're literally impossible. You just won't do anything. Exactly. That's just misery. Right? Yeah. You'll just get trapped. Like I've been thinking a lot about like self-improvement, process of self-improvement. Like what it takes and just like I said like focused on like growing from just like what I've been through and like the hurt I've also caused. When you say hurt you've caused what do you mean? I think regardless of who you are like I think part of the curse of being human is the fact that you will inevitably hurt the people around you and the people that you care about. No matter how hard you try to be good and to be right it is inevitable that you're going to end up wronging and hurting the people around you. And so I've been spending a lot of time just thinking about that and reflecting on what it takes to be better like what it takes to improve after that. And maybe it's a little bit dramatic to frame it this way. If you think about evil what really drives people to do things that are wrong. I think it's almost always a response to pain. Like I think it's very rare that like it's just that someone's like sadistic or their sociopath or that they don't have any empathy. I think it's almost always a response to hurt and pain and how that pain drives a person to not be their best self and to not do what they would normally do even if like for me like even if I can recognize now that that wasn't the right thing to do. And so the trap that it's easy to get caught into is on one hand it's easy to use that pain to excuse the things that I've done to say that oh like I was hurting I was in a bad place like people were treating me badly so that means that I don't need to take responsibility for the hurt that I've caused to other people. And the thing is that you can't avoid that responsibility. The truth is is that no matter how bad of a place you're in like that doesn't change what you've done to other people and that doesn't change what I did to hurt the people around me. But at the same time if I don't accept how much pain I was really in the pain that caused me to like treat other people badly in the first place that's going to prevent me from being better and doing better to the people around me just as much because it's very easy out of guilt to think oh like I don't deserve to feel bad about the place I was in. I don't deserve to feel bad about the pain that I was in about how much I was hurting like I should have done better when I was doing my best. I was trying my hardest in the circumstances that I was. It's honestly just not honest to say that I could have tried harder or I could have done better because the reality is that I was trying my best and sometimes like you try your best and that's just not good enough. If you aren't able to truly accept your pain and how like if I can't accept my pain and how much badly I was hurting if I'm not able to be honest with myself about who I am in my limitations as a person like if that's going to prevent me from really owning up to the things I did in improving just as much. You need to understand who you are and accept that in order to even know what you're truly capable of and to be able to prevent yourself from doing the same thing in the future. I've been listening a lot to the Kendrick Album Mr. Morrell. I really think like that album is like an amazing like encapsulation like what it takes to really like grow like I think like as I've been coming to terms with my evil my weaknesses like my limitations as a person like that album has honestly been making more and more sense to myself like I just want to like I guess like use it quote from that because I think like Kendrick put the song together much better than I can but he says like my ego dodge my pride look myself in the mirror amity will ain't seen nothing scarier I fought like a pit bull terrier blood I shed could have filled up aquariums tell all my angels carry them every emotions been deprived even my strong points couldn't survive if I didn't love learn to love myself forgive myself a hundred times like that's almost the trouble where you need to be able to look at yourself to look at how hard you really tried to be able to look yourself in the face to understand all the blood that you've shed all the pain that you've been through to get to that point and have empathy for yourself and where you are without using that as an excuse without me using that as an excuse to like avoid responsibility or avoid my consequences to be able to look at myself and say I really was trying my hardest and my hardest wasn't good enough and that's just fucking life but all I can do now is the honest with myself about what I did and who I really am and try and be better to be more than I was the best one of the most difficult emotions to process yeah which is hurt yeah both when you're the one feeling it and you're the one that's caused it right kind of to me it this process has kind of been about like accepting multiple truth so just like you said right I caused hurt and I was trying my best and I was hurting what ends up happening is like either you go into this pit of I'm a bad person I'm this I'm that I don't deserve anything just prevents you from growth it prevents you from living your life it prevents it just keeps you trapped in this personal hell that you've created if you get if you're an empathetic person you look at pain that your actions have created to other people and you completely disregard your own experience right what led you to that moment in the first place especially because we are so caught up in what's morally right and it's very easy it's a lot easier to define that for someone else versus yourself I've kind of experienced the other side of that which is like when someone does something that hurts me somehow I end up blaming myself for it you know yeah I turn it into some kind of and maybe there is some truth to it but you know this scenario where it's like oh somehow I caused them to do that you empathize so much with whoever it is and whatever situation that was that you second guess everything about yourself and you go yeah maybe I deserve that maybe I wasn't good enough right maybe it needed to happen whatever right like maybe they needed to do that thing and that might be true but that doesn't mean you have to completely disregard your hurt right like you have to honor it as well otherwise that should eat you up someone can do what they have to and that can end up being very painful to you but the hard part is like both of those things can be right right like someone can genuinely be doing what's right for them but at the same time that doesn't change how painful it is to you that doesn't mean that your pain doesn't have value it doesn't deserve to be respected for what it is right and like for me my instinctive reaction was to like try and find excuses for them to like justify it to them and like try and find reasons to avoid like feeling my own pain and to avoid like really seeing it for what it was by like justifying it for them I like trying to make excuses and like saying like oh like it's fine like I understand like why they did this but the thing is like if you don't accept your own pain if you don't let yourself feel that if you don't sit with it and like acknowledge and affirm your own experience like that's just gonna end up poisoning like the good things about yourself like you're going to end up poisoning the things that are good about yourself you're gonna end up doing things that you can't even really understand because you're denying your own awareness and understanding of your own emotional response like you can run from your pain you can run from your feelings for as long as you want but that doesn't mean that they'll go away and if you run from them that's just gonna prevent you from expressing them and dealing with them in a healthy way and like again like I guess to like quote like gender cleric because like this game I'm sorry like it doesn't even have anything to do with a beef like I just really love that album and like it's really been like something that's helping me process my own feelings but like there's a part of the song count me out where he's talking to himself and he says like you said I'd be better if I just worked harder without lifting my head up that left me fed up you made me worry I wasn't my best version but you ignored me and just changed the story and then later he says to himself I made you I made a decision never tell how you were never tell you how I was feeling fuck with you from a distance because like when you repress those feelings when you just tell yourself oh just try harder just be better like you don't need to fully feel how you're feeling you don't need to express how you're feeling like you just need to focus on like being a better person like that those feelings don't go away they just end up expressing themselves like unconsciously and like more or less unhealthy ways like like how they can and like I used to think that's what maturity was I used to think maturity was like not letting those emotional responses take control of me I used to think maturity was like just focusing on like oh how should I heal myself afterwards like what should I do in response to these feelings but if you don't sit with your own feelings if you don't let yourself feel what you're feeling if you don't like yourself express how you're feeling if you just focus on like doing the right thing and like you're just gonna end up poisoning like yourself and like your own strengths I mean yeah you're right like as soon as something negative happens like someone brings something up someone close to immediately my reaction was always I have to be better complete disregard of why I did that thing what situation wherein it was just I have to be better or else I'm gonna lose the good things in my life or I have to be better just because I want to be a better person right and it was just constant this constant push towards it but I never took that space to just feel whatever it is or let that come really to me or how I ended up there right yeah like I wouldn't even give myself like yeah like you said like I wouldn't give myself the space to really acknowledge how I was feeling I was just focused on like oh I have to be better and like even there was like self-judgment about why do you feel bad like why are you hurting like I feel like just in general like for negative feelings for me like the instinctive reaction it's oh you're doing something wrong for you feeling bad in the first place when it's like about acknowledging affirming and accepting like the legitimacy of the like the negative emotions and having as much empathy for myself as like I'm willing to have for other people 100% yeah what are my favorite quotes about love is you are loved solely where you may show weakness without provoking the strength and I think that applies just as much for yourself as for anyone else you can't love yourself unless you're willing to be weak to see your limitations to see your anxiety your pain your sadness like everything weak about yourself and to not respond by just saying oh you need to be better oh you shouldn't be feeling this way but instead without feeling a need to be strong like just accepting your weakness for what it is and allowing yourself to be weak you know like when you really like work out and like you're really tired afterwards and it just feels so good to like lie down and like just allow yourself to like feel for you I didn't even know that there was like a mental version of that and I feel like I've been feeling that for the first time now that I'm allowing myself to be weak is just sometimes I'll just like cry for like hours and like afterwards I try not to respond to that anymore by saying like oh you need to be stronger oh like you shouldn't be feeling sad but just allowing myself to feel that weakness to not feel mentally up to the challenge to not feel mentally all there like there is such a feeling of peace just a weightlessness that comes with allowing your mind to feel weak in the same way that like I would allow my body to feel weak when it was really fatifled and it's just like an unimaginably like peaceful feeling I know what you're talking about yeah recently I ended up actually accepting some of the things that hurt me in the past and that was a very powerful thing because there was so much relief that I got from not fighting it like I was fighting myself from feeling hurt yeah isn't that a crazy fucking statement like yeah when the body is in pain we never feel like a need to fight against that right like we accept like okay like I'm physically like not feeling the best like I'm in pain but when the mind's in pain like we have so much ego we have so much self attached to that pain like we see it almost as like we see it as almost like a weakness as like a personal failing for the fact that we're in pain so we can't even accept that hurt when in reality it's just like the body right like sure sometimes it's gonna hurt sometimes it's gonna be 50 but that's not like a failing that doesn't mean that like we're bad as people but it's so much harder with the mind because of how much ourself is invested in yeah all of that yeah I guess theme of this episode is accept your pain I will say like one more thing if I would go for it to bring up one more gender cleared another like one of my like one of my favorite like opening lines to any song ever is like the first lines to mother rights over which like made genuinely be my favorite song ever at this point but the first two lines of that song are I'm sensitive I feel everything I feel everybody one man standing on two words heal everybody and I think when you talk about like having empathy for the world like trying to trying to be better like trying to not hurt anyone I think that that's really what those two lines are getting at where I think it is very easy to respond to your own pain and you're to your own hurt by trying to heal the world by trying to prevent like anyone else in the world from having any pain and I think that first of all that prevents you from accepting your own pain your own hurt because you are trying to cope with it by helping other people I think second of all that's fundamentally impossible and you can't heal everybody like you can't please everybody and like you end up judging yourself and hating yourself for not being able to be there for everybody in the world for being able to be their savior even though like you can't do that like that's just not possible that's just as a human being like you can't like that's just what it is and like finally like I think that desire to help everyone and to save everyone like it self leads to like judgment and leads to like yeah it leads you to judge other people because you think like oh like I know what's best for you like I know like how to like fix your problem they're like if only you've listened to me you can't do that for everyone you can't know that for everyone and that judgment itself can be something like toxic and like poisonous and so I think like yeah like that's just something I really want to mention because that's something that I've really been processing and have been dealing with too because I think that that's something that I used to feel were like I just wanted to be everything for everyone like I wanted to like uplift everyone however I could and that's not possible and it has been a hard long painful process to accept my limitations as a human animal and like for what I am hey man when you grow up like feeling responsible I don't know whatever it may be like you have a sibling you have yeah I don't know you end up playing that role where you're like lifting people let's say like you're as a kid you're maybe a little bit more empathetic or a little bit more mature a little bit more have a more intuitive understanding of the world or of people you end up taking that role where you're always uplifting others you really started darn yeah everything inside you yeah it feels wrong to center yourself that's the thing man like like before 2024 I was telling people I don't know if I've ever just been there for myself like ever before like I always felt like oh I needed to be the right type of person I had to be there for other people like I had to be like I had to work on improving myself like I had to be better like I'd never just allowed myself to be like what I am like and allowed myself to be there for myself and it's been a health journey like learning what that really means learn how to exist how to breathe everything else comes after that but we do we learn everything else first all right that's a good place for us to stop you great Kasi kade Theyatim Badalchairaments K dichar�� Hick Kasi k Kals pineapple Kasi Kasi which it says to me.
