 Okay, it's 630. I can do this. Just have a 7A in math class. I just have to get myself out of bed. I got this. I can do this. I'm ready. I count it 3. 1, 2, 3. Shit. That didn't work. Maybe I should just sit like another alarm on my phone or something. You put that piece of shit. What's the point in getting up anyways? What? Who are you? Who am I? I'm the guy that's gonna save you from looking like a dumb piece of shit in front of all your friends and family. What the fuck? You make no fucking sense. Oh, you want me to make sense? You don't make sense. You want to miss your dumb ass? You have a quiz today and I know your dumb ass didn't study for shit. You're gonna fail that quiz today. So how about you quit embarrassing us and just stay your ass in bed like you always fucking do. dumb ass. Don't you think you're being a little redundant? Oh, there he goes again. Mr. Big Words trying to hide the fact that he's a dumb ass by using the biggest words in the fall-conditionary. That's not even that big of a word. You're missing the point. It's not about the words, it's about the fact that you even try. You realize who I am, right? I'm you. You realize how many times you failed to test this past year? You're a freshman in college. People don't fail shit like that, man. Like you don't get it. It's just not like he's looking. I don't get it. Everything I try is just pointless. I haven't eaten healthy in a week. I haven't called my parents and I promised I'd call them every single day. What's the point? I mean, I can't even deal with what distress of my own inevitable failure. I slept at 2 a.m. last night just watching YouTube when I knew well and good that I had a quiz the next day. I mean, how is I ever going to get out of bed? Shit. I'm really fucking this up. Aren't I? No wonder I'm talking to myself. I mean, I don't think I've even slept properly the past few nights. Ah, yes, my boy. It is me. You're inner psyche. That reminds me. You have gotten far too little to sleep, my boy. Four and five doctors say that you don't learn a thing without eight hours of sleep. So why don't you just go ahead and sleep and sleep an all day and you can try again tomorrow? Yo, what the fuck? You don't know. Fuck this. This is an endless cycle. It's never going to stop and we'll say, get out of this bed and just take the first step towards achieving my goal. I go shower, I go study, I go work, I come on parents, I can actually get some energy going, see some friends, baby steps now. First things first, I could get off my stomach, roll on to my back, and get up and do the rest. On the count three. One, two, three. Oh, I'm okay. At least I made it out of bed. Cool. Should we get started with the intro? Ah, yes. I was going to say because I have like a, I did not think through like the intro or anything like that. Oh, okay. No worries. I have a bit of an intro, but. Okay. Cool. So welcome back guys. This is what is this number eight now? Yes. Today we have a guest joining us. Our guest today is very, very, very funny. He's thoughtful. He's got so many interests. He's artsy. Just an all around G. He's known fondly by his buddies as the gunman. Even though somehow he's furthest, he's the furthest person from a redneck you can think of. He's one of my closest friends here since moving to New York. He's one third of average coffee in, should I say AVG coffee? AVG coffee in Manhattan. He works in business and yet he's still such a joy to be around. He loves movies, gaming, music, art, fashion, and coffee. And he's a proud AMC a-lister. You know that like Willem DeFoe clip describing his friend that's like he goes like there are many things interesting about him. He has a strong connection to classical music. He's gay. That's it. The clip ends there, but that's how I feel about Ganesh except the fact that he's not gay unfortunately. So welcome Ganesh. He has a strong interest in classical music. That's all it. Just class freeze. Cut the rest of your drink. Cut it out. What's up guys? Welcome. I'd like to see you guys pleasure to be on here. That's an incredible intro man. That's that's the most like ornate description I've ever had someone give. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. It's a pleasure to be compared to Willem DeFoe. That and itself is incredible to me. He actually compared himself because he compared himself. Oh you're so right. Describing his friend. I'm just a friend. I would be honored to be Willem DeFoe's friend T.B.H. To be fair. Yeah. To call me gunman as well as nuts on a public body. If someone's listening to me on speaker, they're immediately getting tackled right now. Yeah. We got to we got to build that mega audience somehow, bro. I know. Bring both sides of the aisle together. I would like to clarify that as per my knowledge, I don't think the gunman owns any guns unless I'm wrong. None besides the ones just attached to us. Oh. Yeah. It was it was the fact that like the lack of confidence after that joke in your voice. Yeah. I really pulled it all together. I felt the conference waiting as I just get in the sentence out. I've been there, bro. Yeah. Oh, you see that. Thank you for having me guys. Appreciate being here. This is great. And perfect. Um, I guess we'll start with something simple, right? We'll start with first of all, okay, I'll give a brief description, right? AVG coffee has per what I understand is a seasonal coffee shop that you guys host in your building rooftop where you know, it's just a bunch of people in the community and the neighborhood, your friends. It's just a great time. How would you how would you describe it? And like what the inspiration is and where it's going. Yeah, absolutely. AVG coffee co was a coffee pop up that me and my roommates started up. We've been hosting events about every two to three months and it's mostly driven by South Asian inspired flavors because all three of us are South Asians that were also from the Bay area from free months. And so from there, it's just been taking this interest of coffee into where can we explore it and what's a way we can get good coffee out to our friends and other people who were just interested in good coffee as well. So it's grown slowly from our apartment to making 25 drinks for just our friends to our most recent event, which was Sunday, this past on day, which we made a hundred and seven drinks. And so it's been going a lot of times with people came through. It's been going amazing. So that's really why you got to go is it's just a pop up coffee shop and just growing with our friends are circle trying to keep it going here. That's amazing. So I imagine like this takes a good amount of time, right? Like ideating, like working on different serabes, like different, you know, you know, putting it all together, executing, reflecting. Balance like between, you know, your work life, your other passions and, you know, putting in work for this. Yeah, I mean, we typically have like an entire weekend just dedicated to like getting ready for the event, making serabes the entire week ahead, we're normally like testing out different serabes and like just trying them on ourselves or amongst ourselves and just being like, hey, like does this taste feasible? Like what people enjoy and orange cardamom syrup, which sometimes they don't doesn't taste good. But it's kind of part of the process. It's also the most fun part of the process, right? Because I think the conversation we always have is like, okay, like what's something that you had growing up? Like it does desert thing you've had growing up. And then from there, we just kind of like work backwards into figuring out how do you make that into a drink itself. So one of the ones we did this last time was called a tundai latte. I didn't have tundai grown up. Did you guys have any grown up or are you familiar with this? Yes, well tundai is just like bon without the fucking weed. Exactly. Yeah, so we basically made a latte that was without the weed and also without you know, the typical, I guess it's just milk at it. But this time it's like steamed milk and espresso. Right. And it's just a regular latte. Yeah, but like you know, the thundai syrup was like poppy seeds. Yeah, like a bunch of like different flavors after that. So all of that put together. So that was like our most recent. It's a fun process. Would you do an original one? Original just of my own. No, no, no, no, like a bang version. Yeah, just special requests are always appreciating, you know? Exactly. For for 20 pop up. For 20 pop up. Exactly. Yeah, it's crazy to me that the very first thing people asked us as soon as we said we did something like this was okay, so when are this for us on Martinez? Which like, but we're like, hey, we made this like wholesome event where people can just come and have coffee for free. And it just became like so when are we going to fuck up? Where is my where is that? Exactly. Is that on the road map? I don't think so, but I don't think we're opposed to it either. Like if we were to do like a late night event or something, it's like come through. Yeah, that would be fun as well, you know. Right. Late night, good late night, you can't sleep at all. Okay, here's my question. I now that I've actually thought about espresso martini. It's more, more, you know, involved. What is the point of espresso martini's functionally? Because you can't have more than one of them. Yeah, you can. It just won't be a good time. It's just like a big way of self. Just a more fancy for loco. Yes, that's literally what it is. I wouldn't just trying to go back to like drinking for a loco again. They took that shit out. They took out the caffeine you can anymore. That's right. They got rid of it because it's like a health hazard or something. Right. Yeah, through many people died. Oh my god. I love it. So this is, of course, this is kind of a side hustle of yours. But what is, what is your main job? The main hustle is working at a company called a census. They are a retirement savings and college savings company. So similar to fidelity. If you have a kid that has a five to nine college savings plan for all the listeners that have five to nine college savings plans. Chances are they're probably relatable. Yeah, yeah. For the two people listening that have kids, your plan is probably on our platform. And so my job is working between like our business side and our tech side to understand what we're building, make improvements, build them, break it down, sell on itself. You guys want to open up five to nine. All right. Please. I know you have them. They're going to fire me if I don't get you guys open up a five to nine. So he's actually needs, he needs the commission. My entire role here today is just shouting out all the people that I've borrowed money from. AVG. Five to nine companies. All the products I have to share. All the products. They said you want to be on a podcast and my eyes clue like cartoons like all our sides. And would you say like this is what you, you know, wanted to get into forever? It was a journey in its own, you know, like getting to this point. It wasn't like an intentional thing of, hey, I'm going to go into, you know, this specific industry. But it is a role that like I enjoy a lot because it's a lot of work with people and that itself is like very soul nourishing. And this is part of the journey of like figuring out that like, hey, like maybe I don't feel as comfortable doing something that's more like a technical job, like a coding job or something. But still wanting to be somewhere in technology. I mean, I feel like that's honestly like a good place to start if you want to walk us through like what that journey looked like. Yeah, absolutely. So for the job specifically, the way it started off was I graduated out from the University of California, Irvine, with degree in psychology and a minor in digital information systems. My goal was to go into user interface and user experience research and design anywhere in that field. That was really the core interest coming out of college, which even getting to that point was its own separate journey, but we'll get into that. But after graduating, I joined it to this company called Synoptic, which was a consulting company that had this new higher program where it was like you go in, you express what type of teams you want to work on. And they'll put you towards like a team that focuses on your interests. So throughout the interview process, I was like, yeah, like UI UX, that's what I want to focus on. And they were like, cool, that sounds good. Like as soon as you get in, just make sure you express that to people and they can put you on the right teams. I joined in and they put me on like the data reporting team. I was like, hey, what gives? Where's the score? Where's the score? And they were like, oh, like we don't have any UI UX teams that work in the States. Everyone's in India. So we can't put you on one of those teams. So you're going to be on this team for now. And just keep talking to people and try to see what you can figure out. And you know, so they just straight up lied to you. I should have pushed more when I was in these interviews. And like the first two people that I talked to were like, yeah, I think that should work. It clearly did. But from there, like I just took time working on the data reporting team. And naturally, I found myself getting pulled towards projects that were not so much data reporting heavy, but working with like clients to understand what they wanted to build. So from there, that pulled me towards my role of like a business analyst, which is the role that I'm currently in right now, which is exactly that understanding what's going on and like documenting that. And then I'm just going to clear and putting a path down for them to be able to make the improvements they want to. So that got me interested in this role, which then got me recruiting and then made it into a census, which I've been at for the past two and a half years, getting up to three years soon. Yeah. I always sucks being lied to, but I'm glad I at least worked out. I'm glad that like the role you got into ended up being something that you were interested in or at least like kept you engaged. And so you were able to leverage that. So it wasn't for a waste or anything. But I guess like going back to what you said initially about how you majored in psychology in college and how you initially wanted to go into UI UX. I guess like, why don't you just talk a little bit more about that and like how exactly you got to that. Because I mean, you said like it was kind of a crazy story. Yeah, absolutely. So originally I went in going for computer science. What did you guys end up majoring in? Computer science. So like, I mean, did you guys go into computer science being originally like, hey, like this is the path for me. Like this is my career path. Yes. The baby on this audio medium was shaking and said no. Oh God, no. I knew nothing about computer sense when I got those. What was your guys's I guess approach to like was there ever time where it felt like you hit like a wall. I don't know like if there was like a wall per se, but there was definitely a big period, a very long period of time where I just felt like this was too much for me. Like it was just I just felt behind all the time, you know, like I came into it not really knowing much computer science. Obviously, like a lot of smart people get into it. We've been doing it for a really long time. So it's just like always having to play catch up and also just like it's a different way of thinking. You know, it's like learning a different language entirely. So it's like, yeah. It's like learning how to think in code just takes a really long time. Like I think maybe for some people it comes more naturally. It just depends on how your brain works, I guess, but yeah. Yeah, but I feel like I feel like my friends pull me through. Like I would not have gone through it without my friends. But honestly, that's huge because I kind of got into computer science in a very similar way where I just knew that I enjoy technology. It was just one of these things like I think growing up in the bay, you get set up for like a couple of different industries where it's like, hey, this is the most interesting thing in the world. You should go towards this. That's a technology in like computer science was seemed like a no planer. I got into Irvine for comps. I started stuff out first quarter. I was there everything was fine. Like I was able to get through classes things seem to make sense. I'll be it like a very different type of thinking exactly as you said. But going past that when I started getting to some of the more difficult classes. I started noticing that I was hitting like a very serious wall. And part of that was I didn't feel like I had a lot of friends that I could compare notes against. A lot of times in general, I college just felt like you just got dropped off in like the middle of like a ton of freedom without a ton of direction. And so after a while what I realized is that I was getting incredibly anxious to even do the work that was outlined for me. You know, I couldn't have a natural motivation to go out and be like, oh, like I have this homework assignment out to do. I think one way or another, if you have like an assignment coming up or a project that you have to turn in. Either you'll do it from like the interest of it or you just get so scared about the deadline. They were like, I just have to do it. But I think for the first time in my life when I started doing some of my computer science projects said I didn't know the answers to or I felt blocked by. Instead of actually addressing ahead on I found myself getting into this cycle of getting really anxious from not being able to do the work and just closing my laptop just thinking like, hey, like this is making me lose my mind. I have to close my laptop like get away from this for a moment. And so I close my laptop or let myself guess get distracted by one thing or the other. And then time would build up the deadlines would come by and then get more inches and be like shit like I haven't gotten started on this. Opened the laptop back out realized how far behind I actually am and how much time there is like, oh shit, like 10 hours to the deadline and there's like 15 hours of work to do here. And again, just get so scared about like not being able to do a good job that it just felt like crippling. I just would close the laptop again. And then I felt it didn't mean like not turning in some assignments, just doing some like very poorly or not even doing like the meat and potatoes of projects that we had to turn in. And understandably like this had a very direct impact in that I didn't pass a few of my classes when it comes to computer science. It just became this thing of like avoiding this issue because it just felt so crippling and scary, which you know as I say it out loud, it sounds a little ridiculous like hey, like if it's an issue, go seek help, you know, address ahead on, but I just couldn't explain it like it just didn't feel possible, like it just felt. They just felt like you got locked in, you know, yeah, you know, and so I feel like that put me on a very separate path in what I anticipated as well. I think going into college, it was like okay, like going to computer science, do a little bit of hard work, get your degree, come out work, you know, the path is typically set out for you, especially if you're like brown, I think. The path is like hey, you just do these things you're working right. I think I just got so caught up with thinking like hey, she's going to happen by itself and didn't realize how difficult it was going to be, especially for me, like it was just not for me at the end of the day, but all that put together just made me like not perform to the point where eventually I kind of had to switch out of out of computer science to psychology. Which took its own, you know, searching us like why it's just wanted to go there and. You know, like feel like I mean you mentioned that it sounds kind of ridiculous, but I don't think it sounds ridiculous. I feel like it's so like. And yeah, I mean it's easy to say like the thing to do when you're stuck with something is to go ahead on and seek help, but like I feel like there's a reason why it's not easy, right? You've grown up with it as such a fact that like and we all have to some extent where it's like like an inevitable fact right that you are going to go through this path, become, you know, a software engineer or whatever and live in the Bay and and you know that's how your life will progress. But when that kind of breaks, I mean, how do I say this? It's like when it's not materializing the way you anticipated it would and you've never had to kind of change paths like you've been following that one path for so long. It's debilitating like it's really hard to deal with that and that sounds like what you're going through. Yeah, I mean, I think you kind of nailed it on the head there because debilitating is like exactly the word like I don't know, I've never I'm thankful to say that I haven't experienced that level of like sensation going forward or I haven't I haven't experienced that type of anxiety or lack of motivation to do anything, but it very much cascades into like a lot of other stuff like I for the first time ever I felt the onset of like a panic attack and thankfully I had like friends that I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I'm thankful to say that I haven't experienced that level of like sensation going forward or I haven't I haven't experienced that type of anxiety or lack of motivation to do anything, but it very much cascades into like a lot of other stuff like I for the first time ever I felt the onset of like a panic attack and thankfully I had like friends that I was like, I don't know, I haven't experienced that type of anxiety or lack of motivation to do anything, but not in computer science, but other friends that I've made that were helpful for calming me down. It was a lot of just like, wofol ignorance of like, hey, like I know in my mind, like some of the times that I take these classes, I was like, okay, like even if I do this work right now, I feel like I'm still going to feel this class, like that's pointless, right? And it was again, like a combination of a lot of things. It was not feeling comfortable with the material. I think another piece of it is, like I was saying like the first time you get to college, especially for me, like I had this sensation where I didn't feel like I knew what my purpose or role was there. You know, like so much of the focus was like, hey, get into a good college, right? And then when you get there, like, it just didn't literally connect. I didn't feel like I had a lot of guidance heading towards like, oh, like, hey man, like, this is also like super critical. critical, which again, like can sound obvious to some people here in like, hey, you're in college, what else are you supposed to do here? But it just felt like, hey, like I have all this freedom, I can finally do whatever I want in this place. And part of that is like, if I can do my own thing, maybe I shouldn't do this thing because it is not making me feel good, you know. And that was its own sort of like change of expectation, I guess, from what I anticipated. It was going to be out of me. Yeah, I definitely get that. And yeah, I mean, that's something I felt a lot too. And again, like going back to this idea of like, like how it almost feels like stupid to even be struggling like that. Like I feel like there's so much self-judgment that gets tied into these things. And I guess like this is a more general point I want to start off with, but one thing which has really helped me a lot is understanding that fundamentally procrastination is not a issue about being lazy or about just not wanting to do something fundamentally. It's like an emotional regulation issue. When you have just so much emotionally tied to something, it makes it very difficult to get yourself to do something. And I think for things like this, like when you have this vision for your whole life set out, when you have this idea of who you should be, like it becomes very easy to start judging yourself for not being able to do those things. Like it should be so easy for me to just like put that time out and schedule everything out and get my work done. It should be so easy for me to do these responsibilities that I have in my life. Why can't I do it? That must be a problem with me. When in reality, it's just like, like you said, like sometimes that's just not actually the path that's worse for you or that's sustainable. You have to find what's actually feasible for yourself and like who you are. And when you lose that idea of like what you think your life should be, I mean, like you almost feel like you had such a clear idea for your life. And now that feels like it's starting to crumble so it almost feels like your whole life is falling apart. Even though like in reality, like there are always other alternatives, there are always other options. But yeah, I definitely like I'm someone who's struggled with that a lot. I'm someone who's like I said, like I'm coming to terms with not necessarily being able to be the person who I always thought I should be or not always being able to do the things that I feel like I should be able to do based on who I think I am. And for me in college too, like I definitely struggled with the same things. Like I remember like there was one class where I got so overwhelmed and like anxious that I didn't go to my final. Like I just could not get myself to leave a library and go to my final. And I just had to like email the professor afterwards just being like, hey, like I'm really sorry, but like I had a lot going on in my life. I'm in like a really bad place mentally. And like I literally could not go and take my final. If there's anything like we could do to like work that out. And like even if it's like I have to like take time over the summer to do it or like maybe I just have to retake the class like next semester. Like yeah, like I definitely know what it feels like to reach that breaking point. And like just like how am I almost like pathetic that can feel sometimes to like be in that position. So yeah, I mean, I know I kind of went all of the same thing. I think all the other points you're hearing on like I can associate with a lot of those things because like again, like from anyone else, as you're staying the story, you say the word pathetic and it's like dude, no, like that's not right. Like it's it's very human. But I've also 100% pinned up for some that's been like, hey, like I feel pathetic right now. Yeah, what happened with the story with the final itself? Like was there something that transpired? Sorry. Was there something that came out of that? Yeah, I think, um, yeah, I think my professor just ended up giving me like an alternate like essay that I had to write or something. Yeah, and then like I passed the class. I mean, thankfully, this was like, you know, like COVID, like everything was like kind of passed in the past. So it wasn't like that big of a deal for me. Yeah, I definitely think I looked out a lot with that policy. It's like I think like with COVID and everything, like that, like COVID was a very revealing time for me in terms of like sort of forcing me to admit, admit like my own limitations and like that. I needed like, yeah, that I needed more help and that I couldn't just like deal with everything on my own, especially like when I ran into situations like that. Yeah, yeah. Sure. I'm curious to hear what your guys is kind of self-sue thing approaches have been to situations like that because I can I can share at least for me, it was a lot of like baby steps was kind of the way that I viewed it. Yeah, it was like, okay, like if I can get myself out of bed today, that's a that's a win, right? Like keep taking those wins. Then if I can like, you know, do like 10 minutes of work today, that's a win. So it was a lot of like self-sue thing in like nurturing myself to try to like get into a state where things would happen more naturally instead of just, you know, okay, feeling so locked in and not able to move. Yeah, yeah, I'm curious to hear what type of experiences you guys had towards addressing stuff like that. Yeah, I mean, I think for me, it's pretty similar. We're like, again, like shifting my mindset to focus more on like the small wins because it's like, yeah, like I think a lot of times, like especially if you aren't like, if you're already in a place where you feel like incompetent or you're like, there's a lot of like self-degment about not being able to get something done, I feel like just taking a bit like spending like 5-10 minutes to like clean my desk off or like to clean my apartment, things like that. Keeping track of those like little wins through the day can be like a good way of just like mentally checking yourself and being like, okay, like I know like I didn't get as much done as I maybe wanted to or I didn't get that thing that I really wanted to take care of done, but I still have like all of these things that I was doing throughout the day. I can still see that overall trend where I am getting better at like still, yeah, like still keeping myself like motivated, not letting myself just fall into like a spiral or like a pit. I think that's a big thing and I think another thing is just more being mindful of like how I'm feeling and like being able to check myself there because I think like I said like realizing that it's an emotional regulation issue has made it a lot easier for me to realize when I am that stressed or that anxious and to be like, okay, like why are you feeling this way? Like is this actually something like like your death like is this something that's actually that urgent or is it just that like again like you have so much like emotionally invested in this that you're not thinking about it clearly and like I think a lot of times taking a step back to like think about that can kind of make me realize how distorted my own thinking is about the situation like it can make me realize that like okay like sure maybe it would have been better if you had more time to finish this thing, but you can still do like a good job like with time you have and like even if you can't at least I can understand how I got to that point I can have like more acceptance of myself and be like you know you're working on this you know you're obviously not at the best right now but let's just stay focused on like doing what we can with the time that we have versus like making the situation worse but pushing it off more and like falling further and further into the state. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, yeah it takes a lot of like recognition that moment to be like hey like yeah, I need a pause I need to like take a second here which you know sometimes that can happen much later than desired but still so one of those things. Yeah, oh yeah it's it's hard to do. And like like you said like like it can take a while but then like again like that can end up feeding into like a cycle of self-judgment too where it's like you also need to be willing to like forgive yourself and like keep perspective on like how much progress you've made because like for me now maybe sometimes like it'll still take me like half an hour like an hour or something sometimes to like really realize the state I'm in but then I remember like in the past sometimes it would take me days like I would just spend like days like in that anxious like panic state. So it's a long process it's definitely a struggle. It's not something that's ever like easy or like that you ever like get perfect but yeah you just need to keep like chipping away at that blunder and like keeping perspective on like how much better things are. Yeah, I think that metaphor chipping away at the boulders is an interesting one because it's it's always like I've always found that at any point of time there's like maybe one thing that works or like one quote that motivates you but just as like you have any tool that'd be used to chip away a boulders sometimes it was break and then you have to go get new ones. Yeah and that itself of found sometimes can be like a disheartening process of like oh shit like I thought I figured this out I thought I had some of that yeah yeah shit okay let me go find something else. Oh what fucking self-book do I need to read right now to like yeah I know there's a solution right yeah and that's that's like so that itself can be so disheartening because it's like you don't know how long it's gonna take to find that other thing right and it's like that can make it hard to have confidence in yourself and have trust in yourself if you're like how do I know this tool that I'm using isn't gonna break like in the middle of this process how do I know how long it's gonna take to like get myself out of this fun like this time. What's the point man why why do anything at that point right exactly that's just like right you just gotta try how you can. I think it becomes less about the tool right it's like I feel like because your tool is gonna break you know what I mean like you're gonna you're gonna grow with you your anxiety is gonna grow you it's gonna find new ways to manifest itself um situations are gonna change and just things that work before aren't gonna work anymore and so it's I feel like it's more really about like the tool is really the process of like yeah finding your inner voice to you know stop yourself and take a step back and really fall in love with that process yeah that process of taking a step back self-care yeah analysis and then and then restart right if you're comfortable with that process and not dreading it I think that's the key yeah trusting the process and that means fundamentally trusting yourself to be able to like follow the process yeah yeah I mean I'll tell you this much hearing that I think back when I was 18 19 would have been huge right be like hey like just trust the process go through it it's okay if like your test cases start failing keep going you know yeah I know that feel yeah and I feel like to a certain extent it's like you like uh until you really experienced that like how the fuck can you really trust the process right like it's only like once you've struggled through it a couple of times that you can really start to be like okay like it nothing is actually going to bump in my life like my life isn't actually falling apart like yeah even building that trust takes time through experience I don't think that's something you can ever be told you know like I think that's something you just need to go through and like feel yourself and people telling you can just help you keep perspective in the moment yeah there's no golden reset of rules to follow you know like it's really just trial and error yeah hello welcome to your well-the-session I'm going to share some facts about your Audi your Audi is an exemplary person so please sit back and try to enjoy each fact equally these facts are not to be shared with anyone but for now they're yours to enjoy your Audi is kind and generous your Audi takes two sins before work every day your Audi scrolls Instagram while taking a piss at the urinals he's so efficient just like you your Audi owns a bright orange Cybertruck your Audi loves waffles and cool aid your Audi enjoys being packed your Audi feels a soft bottles with regular soap your Audi likes to separate the art from the artist your Audi thinks straight one the beef thank you for attending this wellness session I hope you feel well I'm curious to hear who you guys thoughts on this because I feel like a large part of this keeps coming back to me when it comes to like new projects right like self-interested projects and stuff where I'll be like oh like I have an interest in like writing and stuff and I'll be like okay I'm gonna write a little bit more and then this kind of like self-consciousness starts creeping in and like I think all these things that we were talking about today different iterations of those start popping up with you guys on the podcast like why do this like when does that self-conscious demon start popping up being like hey like why are you doing this you know like what's your guys is the way of approaching them it's funny you say that I feel like literally before we started this season I was like it hit me one day I was just like why am I doing this like what like what do I possibly have to say that's worth putting out there right and also also feeling really anxious about putting myself out there in the first place where it's like all this stuff about me is just there you know for people to listen to um yeah is it too much you know is it like am I yeah am I overexposing myself like is this some kind of weird coping mechanism is it just a sign of weakness that I'm doing this uh yeah dude I mean I don't honestly I would be lying if I said I'd figured out how to deal with that but the only thing that's helped is the perspective that I have seen it helped people and people reach out and thank me for it uh and thank us for doing it and really appreciate what we do yeah so it really keeps coming back to the fact that even if this can even if one person can listen to this and feel 10% better it's worth it yeah I mean yeah I can say to that like even like me sharing the story of like oh here's the story of how I fucking have to get out of a major and like completely tank a major to like figure out what to do with life it's it's inherently like when I think to it like it's not something I say with like a smile on my face most of the time I'm appreciative that this is like a safe space to be like hey like I can talk about it openly and it's something in my past but still deeply like embarrassing at times right but I think that is the hope which is you can say something that resonates with someone can help them fund their path and a little bit more you know yeah yeah no and I definitely feel like a lot of times like that's something that's hard for me if you keep perspective of because it's like I honestly don't know if I ever tell it anyone the story that I had just said to you guys about like me not being able to go to a final because I was just like so like correct like motivation wise and it's like a lot of times like I feel like even for me like I don't really know what I'm gonna get out of it until I really go through that and I feel like that's even a part of like trusting the process like not trying to get too fixated on like what am I getting out of this like what is the value and just like trusting my own instincts and like trusting that like I mean there are things that I've tried to do before which I have never been as consistent about as this podcast and so there has to be something that's like drawing me back to it that I'm getting out of it and even if like day to day and like episode to episode I don't necessarily even know that until afterwards even if like sometimes thinking back it's hard for me to remember like what exactly I got out of it like again I think it's just like trusting those instincts and trusting that process yeah absolutely I feel like it's a shift of like why you do something right like you should do something not because there's some kind of final goal associated with it right like like if you're starting a podcast don't start a podcast because you want to become the next J Shetty you know what I mean like that's not the goal like like do it because you want to go through the experience you want to learn about what it takes you want to you know express yourself that way and feel what it's like and if you do that like the experience is valuable no matter how long you do it right like you and I Ganesh we started writing a fucking we started writing a TV show yeah a script for a TV show we I feel like we went pretty hard on it for like two weeks and fantastic ideas but ultimately I feel like maybe it's not the right time for us to get into that you know really go at it but that that even those two weeks or months however long we had those conversations like I don't regret any of that like that was so valuable in terms of I understand something a little bit more now and like maybe if I wanted to express myself that way like I know what it would take but that's all like I feel like it's just this perfectionist mindset that you have to find yeah where it's like what's the point of doing it if I don't like what's the point of taking the acting class if I'm not gonna if there's a less than 0.01 percent chance I'd become an actor you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah I can't tell if this is like a symptom off of like COVID or something we're like it feels like a lot of decisions in life that started becoming like very like calculated or maybe it's just a symptom of like getting older but like everything like the cost value what does that cost value benefit yeah yeah essentially cost benefit analysis the cost benefit analysis has been kind of brought to the forefront come on Brian I thought you were a business analyst shouldn't you know I studied psychology you know that's your excuse you know my favorite thing is whatever like someone says something about their emotional it's just like trust me I study psychology I know all the ants no I'm a professional why you need a therapist you study psychology exactly talk to myself just figure it out yeah it's not that it's cyberbullying walk away from the screen that's one of the most iconic tweets ever how how is procrastination real bro just pick up your computer is new bro yeah you know I've heard that piece of motivation sometimes around like oh like motivation isn't gonna strike you you have to like make it happen right which sounds really good but it's really fucking hard it's really hard to be like hey like I want motivation to strike me I want to feel this urge to do something to just be like just do it there's no other way to do it it's a hard mental barrier a lot of times you know and I feel like I don't know what the golden solution is here it's not like I think inherently that's the only approach which is you do it you know but I don't know it's always been like something that I've found as a recommended piece of advice that she's always had a hard time digesting you know yeah I think that's something that I've also been coming to terms with recently where it's like even if like it's like even if I'm passionate about something even if there are times where I'm super motivated there are gonna be times or I really don't want to do that shit and discipline is almost like the connective tissue between different moments of inspiration and motivation and it's like having that discipline allows you to be motivated and be inspired more often too because like when you put that time in a lot of times you may not realize in the moment that something's gonna be engaging but like once you start doing it it is like I definitely have felt that where it's like I don't want to have to put in effort I want it to just be this effortless feeling of like being inspired and not even having to try so yeah I definitely think that's part of the eternal struggle that's so hard to me man because yeah like I've literally thought that exact thing which is like oh I think the issue is just I'm not disciplined like I have no discipline like how do I how do I build this now you know yeah it's like even if you build discipline in one thing not being able to do it in another thing well then cascade and be like oh like if I'm not disciplined about this other thing what about this thing that I am disciplined about is that even real you know and then that starts shaking confidence sometimes which I feel like has been something that I've experienced before it's very disheartening I think yeah yeah to your point you just have to quiet out all the voices in your head but yeah easier than you have done there was this book that I had read a long time ago it's really stupid like this is gonna sound dumb but like it was called act like a leader think like a leader it was like it was some book that when I got into like consulting in college that it was like a recommended book by the yeah national order whatever sorry read it but like I feel like you know I don't even think I'm qualified to say this but the concept of the book was like you can't wait for your mind to get right yeah right like if you want to start being more extroverted or like reach out to someone whatever it is um you can't wait to get in the right mindset like your mind needs to be shown what's possible so you just need to do it and your mind will follow will create patterns after that which I thought was always helpful even though I feel like personally like I'll be honest here and I'm looking for maybe some perspective but like I don't think I struggled with procrastination in the same way that you guys are describing I think for me like my anxiety manifested in a way where I just had to do everything like I had to do everything before I felt any kind of peace and that just resulted me in me always doing stuff and never feeling any peace yeah but but at least I was efficient you know what I mean like I got a lot of shit done that way yeah right uh peak performance so peak performance right um but I would always like you know some of my friends people around me um they would I would see some people struggle with uh you know something that they had to do but they just couldn't do and I would just not understand like I would and I'm a person who's very like really always trying to like lift everyone up like help everyone all the time obnoxiously too much yeah and I've toned it down a lot because it was really annoying but um but I was that person and I would just I would sometimes I would stare at these people and I'd be like just do the fucking thing like why aren't you just doing the thing right and I just wouldn't understand so um I feel like I'm learning something here uh since then I feel like I have experienced that kind of procrastination a little bit so I kind of understand a little bit more now uh but yeah I'm curious like if you have any like if you see someone it if what advice would you give someone who is experiencing that they're seeing someone around them that they care about go through this like what would you tell them to how to respond how to react yeah um I think like the biggest thing is like helping ground them like I think like I said like giving them some perspective about like just like talking them through like the thought process of like okay like how much time do you actually need for this like how much time do you have what are you capable of like how important is this thing really like what are like the consequences like if you don't do this thing as well as you want to I really think it's about like getting someone out of that like anxious mind state and like getting them to start think that through those things in like yeah like a safe environment so that they can start to realize like okay um like yeah maybe like I am like exaggerating this thing um but I do think like like always with like mental health like I think that there's only so much you can do and like sometimes like when you're in that mindset like you just kind of have to ride it out and like I don't think that there's you can only do so much to help someone and sometimes they just need to like go through that and then maybe afterwards you can talk to them about it and be like um hey like like yeah like just talk through the situation with them yeah I 100% agree with everything you said out here because I think grinding someone's huge like it is very much like you're stuck in a thinking trap right you get stressed out I don't know how to do this and then it just builds more anxiety just get trapped in um one of the things that I'd say is ask it like like you're saying ask the question you know push dig in a little bit you know I think for people that don't feel very confrontational or don't enjoy confrontation it can be a little difficult to go in and be like hey like it looks like you're just getting too stressed out to do anything right and to say something like that to someone's face also feels rude sometimes to be like hey like I think you're losing your shittles that you need to calm down which is really what needs to be said but it's very hard to say that yeah so I think one of the things that I started doing when I noticed it with other people is sort of I think statements which is just being like again like I'm that person that doesn't like confrontation and still has to like push itself too but I'll be like hey like tell me how the sounds but I think you're doing this and when you frame something like that I've found that a lot of times people may agree with you they may disagree with you but at least you're framing it very clearly that this is my opinion you have a say in this so I could be like hey they I think you're burning yourself out I think you're getting too anxious about your work and it looks to me like you're not doing this what does that sound like to you has been a way that I've approached it that feels less confrontational feels like it engages a conversation that's supposed to just being like hey man like wake up stop this you know yeah yeah yeah almost what you're describing is like it's it's a lot more inviting you're inviting that person to come into the shared space and like figure out this problem right but I definitely have that been that person in the past which is shaking the other person like wake up and do the point and I just I feel like I've made it worse in a lot of situations I honestly like I'd like to hear the thoughts on this but in it sometimes I do feel like even being that person is better than like not asking something you know like right it being that person to be like overly aggressive and just be like yo like shut the fuck up and do this sometimes will give you the jolt that you need how that relationship with that person may be after that that's that's a separate question but yeah yeah like I think like especially if you're friends with someone like they can like like there times where like people have done things like that to me and like I might get like annoyed in the moment but like even if it didn't really help in it yeah like sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't even if it doesn't like I feel like I I understand like if it's coming from a genuine place like that's not what they intended and so like like I mean like we're we're all not perfect people right like I think that the least you can do is give someone else grace for like trying and even if it's not necessarily in the best way um I will say like I think the most important thing in those situations is to make that person feel safe because I think like that underlying anxiety it's like when you're anxious you feel unsafe and I think that if someone responds like aggressively to you like that can make it feel even harder and like make make the environment feel even more like unsafe and I think um yeah like yeah like like I said like there's only so much you can do like it's very easy again like even if you approach things in the right way sometimes like when I'm procrastinating I can get annoyed and be like don't tell me if I'm not prioritizing this thing right you haven't been standing anywhere near as long as I am um but yeah I think it's just like trying your best to make them feel secure and like make them feel like yeah like they're doing okay and that they're in an okay place yeah yeah I should say that's fair uh love that's that's a much more like proper like suggest like as depending on like your friendship with a person yeah be aggressive if that feels fitting within the realm of your friendship but yeah I think what you're getting to is like genuinely at the right point here which is like yeah like safety is important and like you know depending on your situation like maybe your friends are aggressive people and it's like its own like environment that feels safe but inherently yeah tough love tough love tough love but no and there's like make those first yes or line in the mouth punch them like in that I have a question um so you guys kind of I mean coming back to like motivation a little bit right like I have kind of experience this maybe in the last year and a half maybe two years um but this like kind of you know like you're waking up right you're in bed you're waking woken up and then your brain is like telling you to get up and like you know you should get up and do the thing and you start your day or whatever tasks you need to do but and maybe it's like and I don't know like I found your brain is like yelling at you maybe there's some like persuading happening you know okay I'm gonna wake up at this time or whatever um or right after I do this right some cajulling happening some trying to trick yourself to get up almost yeah um but somehow you just can't like I feel like I have an experiences thing like I just can't get up for some reason and yeah it's I haven't like I haven't really figured out what that is what happens like is it fear is it like is it exhaustion like is it like what is that thing do you know what I'm talking about and how do you like how do you come out of that um I mean I'm someone who that happens a lot like that's a pretty regular thing for me um and yeah that that's fundamentally just anxiety like when I am gonna have a very stressful day and when there's stuff that I'm already anxious about or if I had like a very clear vision of what I wanted the day to look like and maybe like I already woke up late um like yeah that anxiety can make it even harder for me to get out of bed um and like yeah like and it feels like exhaustion it feels like I literally am so tired like I can't get out of bed even though like fundamentally it's just that anxiety um I'd say for me like the biggest things that I've been working on are first um like if you're already tired like if you haven't gone enough sleep that's gonna be so much harder to get out of like it makes so much worse yeah so just making sure I'm consistent about that um I think the next thing is sort of softening my inner voice and like just giving like not like screaming at myself anymore just being like okay like I understand why you're anxious but like you know you're gonna just feel worse like if you stay in bed like come on let's try our best to like just sit up let's try our best to like um get the day started and like just do what we can now that we're here um and yeah I think softening my inner voice has helped a lot and then when I can't get out of bed um just giving myself grace like just being like I know that I'm trying my hardest I know that I don't really want like I don't want to stay in bed like I know that like like I'm doing the best that I can and if I can't like get out of bed any faster than this like like I mean there's literally nothing I can do right like I know I'm trying my hardest and how like how long it takes after that isn't something that's in my control you know like I just have to try my hardest and be okay with that I think those are all like exactly like the recommendations I'd make as well you know build enough that like baby steps you know if you can't you guys ever watch uh kill bill along the first one yeah there's a scene in the kill bill that I always think about which is wiggle your toe uh for context like this this person would have been comatose for many many years uh and then woken up and then trying to will themself to get up and get in a car and drive away but in order to get there she stares at her big toe and just says wiggle your toe wiggle your toe right which is another visual motif for this idea of like you just got to get yourself to do like the minimal ounce of effort that you can something so small that you know it'd be it'd be dumb not to be able to do right so it's like you're so in bed sometimes maybe it's you know move your finger you know just just shift positions a little bit sometimes that helps sometimes it may not I think to to hear this point sometimes you just need the rest you know like shit yeah and like you can you can force yourself to sleep five hours and keep getting up and doing work just because you have a lot of stuff to do but at some point your body will not listen to you and sometimes it'll just be like hey you need the rest which is I think built into this idea of like softening your voice I think that's a very nice way of putting it which is yeah you just have to be kind to yourself and it's okay because you just need that time to recover and in other ways honestly if you really need to get up sometimes change of environments sometimes like if I if I I mean this is very circumstantial but if I know for a fact I have to get up at 6 a.m. and I know I've had struggles with this I won't even sleep in my bed I'll go sleep on the couch simply look over just shift of environments sometimes it's good for like that quick moment of like if you know you're exhausted you know you're having a tough time try sleeping on the couch if you have to wake up at like 6 a.m. catch a flight and you feel like you don't feel fully confident right like trying to break the pattern a little bit yeah new new stimulus exactly yeah yeah yeah I do the exact same thing like I always sleep on the couch if I'm gonna get less than like like if I get like less than like 5.5 hours of sleep and yeah I feel like it helps me get up in the morning and it's also like at least it's almost like telling myself that like yeah today's gonna be kind of a shit day but it's okay it's like a bit of mental preparation for the day honestly yeah even on those like shitty days I don't know if you guys do this but like journaling does help I say this is someone that like yeah is not consistent with journaling at all like I'll do it for like a week and then like there you go like not doing it again but like allowing your small wins it doesn't feel like a lot but inherently you find yourself remembering a lot more about what you did which yeah sometimes unconsciously is like a huge motivation sometimes yeah like especially like if you're already tired like you're not gonna remember all those small wins you had and like even if it doesn't help the most in the moment I feel like sometimes looking back and being like oh shit I actually did a lot more than I thought that day like even back and beyond yeah so you mentioned like wiggling toes is interesting because it suggests it suggests that I'm a like yes that was not suggested you just chose to drop that one out of nowhere for it's like I think you just out of your excuse to mention that your your your Audi has I choose to die I throw myself on your but I feel like it suggests the wiggling toes thing it suggests that like it's some kind of it makes me feel like it's some kind of like dopamine hole that you're in where it's like even like the small amount of movement generates some dopamine that can generate you know a chain of events that can get you up basically yeah like like a spark is what I'm imagining by that yeah it's interesting because I feel like it's not a lack of motivation right like I feel like it's important to say that it's not like oh how do I get myself motivated um unless I mean you can disagree with me but like I feel like it's not a lack of motivation it's just for some reason maybe it's that anxiety that you're talking about yeah is that like my body and my mind are just not in sync at all yeah yeah I think that's that's the right way of putting it sometimes because like motivation I think is the big scary concept that like we'll always come back and hide you being like okay like your bottom line is you have no motivation but as with any situation that the nuances of it or that hey like you do feel anxious about something you do feel scared or you just feel like there there's something underlying that will often keep you from going towards that right yeah um so yeah there's I agree with you in that and saying that like motivation is the big scary term that masks the underlying stuff that either is being addressed or not yeah and like that's why kind of like like I've been saying like I think it's much better to think of it as an emotional like issue as opposed to a motivational one um in terms of like what you actually need to do to get over that and in terms of what you said about like the mind in the body being out of sync like I honestly think that that's like you know like a very deep and like very important like point about all of this um and something that I've been trying to think about and keep in mind more is that like I think that when the mind in the body get out of sync like that like like when we have like when we have like emotional problems or like yeah they're like we have like mental health problems and things like that it almost always primarily manifests through like that disconnect between the mind and the body and I find like that can be a very like I feel like sometimes now like focusing more on how my body feels as opposed to what my mind is telling me can give me a lot more clarity about how I'm feeling and like the state I'm in and um yeah like focusing on those physical sensations can help ground you um and help like yeah like start that process of like um getting over that or like dealing with that more effectively yeah I think there's that common activity uh I think it's what are five things around you that you can see four things around you they yeah you know I've done this activity before with other people sometimes that I think or seem like they're anxious and like sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't you know but it's definitely a step in the right direction to be like okay here's a means of grounding yourself for a second yeah yeah it's kind of like yeah just pulling yourself out of your mind right like you just get lost in it and all those abstractions you make in your head and you just forget that you live in the real world and there's like so much stuff around you great just being exist I feel like once you really you can finally identify with I mean the things that helped me is a lot a lot is like once I started being able to ground ground myself in a way I mean I feel like people say ground myself but like sometimes it's like hard to understand what they mean but now I finally get it where it's like the moments where I felt that is when I just feel like I'm I'm just really aware of my existence you know the physical space that I take up in the world uh and the stuff around me and just like once I've practiced started to like gain that perspective I think that's helped me like pull out of my head a lot more quickly yeah yeah I mean if there are people who practice Buddhism they can correct me if I'm butchering the concepts here but that's always what I took away from that explanation of like uh being at a state where you are not worried about material things you're not worried about all these like minute details but it's just like a state of being it's like almost like a state of like auto play that gets you to just true peacefulness you know uh that was like I thought that kept coming back to me sometimes during this journey of like hey like it's okay to like you you're trying to get yourself to like go absent-minded in a way or like not nitpick over every last detail you know or for for another example like if you're running you know like that's similar to what a runner's high feels like sometimes where you're not thinking about the fact that you're running at this pace or that each step is like this distance or the time it's just you're in that moment and there's nothing else around you that impacts your your sensations at that moment and that's like the ideal state to get to but everything else is in the in the way of trying to get to there sometimes you know yeah I am not my thoughts I am the thing experiencing my thoughts and yeah I think like for me it's been about not confusing those two and like allowing myself to just be clear and experience things without always having that mediation in between with my thinking yeah absolutely do you ever feel like on this journey like during these experiences do you feel numb ever like is that a sensation yeah like numb to other emotions because of you know what you're going to yeah for sure like it would be I think the numbness would set in once there was a feeling of like overwhelmingness sometimes you know being like hey there's too much stuff going on and yeah almost in a way of like the other side of the coin which is I'm not going to get myself to get out of my bed for the sake of not experiencing more stuff you know it's it's like getting into a catatomic state where it's just like I don't want to move I don't want to test the limits of it's right now or it doesn't feel going back to the idea of your body not being in sync with your mind you just don't feel like you want to like move you know so when you when this stuff was you know this sensation was at its peak like how did you kind of like what was that like like thying the numbness you know and kind of returning to or creating some kind of equilibrium or some kind of like like what was it like getting to a state where like you could feel again and feel okay with what you were doing yeah for sure I think a large part of it was starting to reach out to people for for assistance as well um like when I was talking about feeling an onset of a panic attack I think it was like one a.m. or something and I'd walked over to my friend's dorm and I was like hey man are you still awake and he's like I'm about to knock out and I'm like all right like come out of your dome for a little bit like having him out there and just talking to him like kind of like shook me out of like the kind of like fugue state I felt like I was getting into uh similarly like reaching out to family as well I think that's when I started telling my parents about the sensation of like anxiety tell my mom my sister my dad being like hey like this is something that I feel happening and you know like bedding itself can feel very scary because uh you know indeed parents and some of these resessions of like hey like anxiety is a real right yeah eat some fruit and go sleep uh exactly yeah and it wasn't a lack of that either like you know my mom would talk to like the priest and stuff and she'd be like okay say this one like prayer like five times a day if you say this it'll help you and yeah quite honestly like I am more appreciative of that despite like that sounding like so like hey like out in the federal world of this like fantasy uh solution because sometimes that could be the thing that grounds you but uh that was also its own interesting conversation where it would be sweet to me to hear my mom ask me like I think when I moved to New York like many many years after all this stuff that happened uh she'd asked me one day just being like hey how's your anxiety like do you feel like your anxiety is still there and I was like this is crazy to me like I didn't know that you were still tracking this as like a thing that was that had happened and being asked that was a nice reminder of like hey like these people are not there to like antagonize you they remember these things and like seeking that help helped out a ton you know because it became the thing where I was talking to my mom where she'd be like okay how are you feeling today or she'd check in on that and a lot of times that sensation of being checked in on at least for me that brought some life back to me it was like okay like I'm not going through this alone there are some people that give a shit about this because again like it can get scary and like the descending thoughts can start becoming more worrying at a certain point to feel like hey like I'm just going through this by myself there's nothing else second like help me in this you know like does traps do exist and having those people there can snap you out which helped me out a lot and then so what was the point where you decided like that you wanted to switch out of CS like was that like something that was in your head and it took you a long time to come to terms with and actually execute on or was it like a light bulb type because I feel like I feel like a lot of people go into college seats without knowing that you know without knowing if it's what they want to do myself included and a lot of people just go through experiences like you did and for a lot of people they just realize maybe it's not for them but they stick through it and maybe end up having some experiences like that because because there's so much stigma around moving out of it and trying something else like oh this is not the most optimal path anymore this is not like there's so much shame and stigma and let's say there's a person right in college right now losing like a very similar spot that you were in there and CS are pre-med or law or whatever and they have this they grew up with this tunnel vision like mindset of like okay I need to be successful in this they're not liking it they're not able to it just feels wrong you know like what advice do you give someone like that yeah I mean I'd say have conversations that's a big thing I'd recommend have a lot of conversations around what specifically you want to get into just talk to people about what they're doing and see what peaks your interest um I think the biggest way to approach this is based off of what sounds interesting to you and following that just understanding what that looks like and it doesn't even have to be something that may be adjacent to what you're already looking at right if you're sitting on the technology side of things and you talk to a biomed kid and what they're doing in the biology class sounds interesting to you that's at least a conversation being had and that's an interest that's being built in some way uh I think there's a lot that needs to be done towards just getting to know what you like versus what you don't like I think understanding that is always like a good way to approach that and right on top of that I'd say talk to facility talk to professors especially if your college could email professors and just be like hey like I want to like ask you and like pick your brain about something and try to talk to them about like the why specifically that chose this and describe your situation as well like people have had experiences similar that they'll guide you on the right path or they'll tell you something that might peak your interest you know that's how those are the uh yeah no honestly like you the thing you said about like learning what your likes versus your dislikes like I feel like so many people just struggle with that you know like I feel like because that interest what I feel like I was in a person what even now I feel like to some extent it's like a lot of things are interesting to me you know what I mean but like but I think the way our minds work when we grow up in these environments where it's just like what is the optimal path what is the optimal path right like that like in dislike it's lust yeah like you don't even learn to recognize what you're really interested in or what you really enjoy so it's just like if it's not CS what else you know and then it's just like everything else like things feel interesting but then it's like it's hard to justify switching because it's like not the optimal yeah and you're just trained to look for the optimal optimal path all the time yeah it feels like an indulgence yeah yeah right like you don't deserve it like how dare you go appreciate the arts today like don't you have an assignment to work on or something like not just I if you're struggling I'll say this if you feel like what you're in right now it doesn't sound interesting to you find out what you like and don't like not even from the goal of figuring out what your new major or what your new life purpose is going to be just to find yourself appreciating something because when you like something you feel like you're in a good mood and maybe you find that this is something that you want to actually study and if you don't at least you had a good day and that is a big way you know outside of that I'd say make yourself uncomfortable make new friends if you feel like your social circle is all focused on the same thing feel free to open up your social circle go to places that you haven't been and try to talk to people that you haven't talked to before if you feel anxious and worried about that externalize that tell those people being like hey yeah like I'm interested in this honestly it's intimidating for me to be here because I don't know anyone in this field or this seems new to me and gotten itself will open you up to people taking you in you know when you tell someone that you don't feel like you belong in this space you'll always end up finding someone that'll find you and say hey here's how you find your path then that's a really beautiful thing you'll always be able to find that path whether that be through a professor through useful social circles you know college especially is a great place to do that even a community college where it might not feel like there's as much of the community there are real people here who have gone through either the exact same sensations you're going through or felt something similar and if you multiply that by all the people you're surrounded by that's you know 300 500 thousand people that have experience that we cannot learn from all right boys I think I think we got everything I think that was good cool I guess we'll just wrap up yeah so I guess we're near in the end now and but it's such a great conversation I'm gonna thank you so much for coming thank for having me yes yeah it was great and we should do this
