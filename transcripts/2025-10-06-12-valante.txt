 Welcome to PBR. Are you ready? Yes, let me put my retainer in. Gotta put them grills, am boy. Yes, sir. I saw the randomness video of a chemist making grills for themselves because they were just like, I don't have any jewelry, but for some reason I want grills. So they just like literally using chemicals, extracted gold and molded them into grills. And that made me start thinking if I want grills. Why do you want, what are you going to do with crows? Why do they want jewelry? Don't you have to take them off before you eat grills? Can you eat with them? I mean, I feel like you have to take them off, right? Wow. It's like also do you want like, food and shit getting all over your gold grills? Maybe you don't have to like brush his off. I don't know. Anyway, I don't want to get into this. Post in the comments if you know whether you can eat with your holes. All right, welcome back guys. Thank you. Thank you. Anything else? Anytime. Okay. Okay. Today's guest is just so insanely special. Like, he's been a fan of the show since day one literally giving us like encouragement and feedback and to be very, very honest. Like, I feel like I've become an even bigger fan of his after you know, finding out who he was. He's a professor. He's a producer of some of the most like calming, relaxing, joyful music that I've ever heard. I mean, each, I feel like each song is different. But I've been looking forward to this episode for a long, long time. So I'm pumped that it's finally happening. So yeah, welcome to the show. Thank you so much. Can I just, I just want to like set the record straight. I'm not, I'm not a professor. I'm a teacher. But, you know, just a professor sounds so damn fancy. Maybe, maybe someday in the future, but I'm a teacher at a junior high school. I'm a language teacher, not to like disappoint anyone, but, you know, I have a history of getting our guest out of the profession wrong somehow. No, or is no word. And, and yeah, just a quick backstory. I have been a fan since day one. Two days, two years ago, almost to the week now, I left my then fiance of, we've been together for six years. And I was just lost and broken and hurt. And I was just looking for representation. I just needed to feel like I wasn't alone in the, in the pain of it all. And I found your first episode and it became sustenance then and there, I'd say. And yeah, I'm, I'm really grateful for that episode. So thank you. I'm a fan as well. You guys. Yeah. I mean, you have no idea what that means. I feel like that's the great way. I wish it. But yeah. Yeah. It was, it was so cool because I mean, the, the podcast was super new. And I remember I was looking for people going through similar things. And you obviously have these like super, super big podcasts to invite these like gurus talking about relationships and everything. But I wanted more like a subjective take on what I was going through, but from someone else. And yeah, just to paint a picture to anyone listening, I was sitting in my car. It was raining. It was on the side of the road. I listened to you guys and I cried and yeah, it was, it was beautiful. Yeah, I mean, that's incredible to hear. And I mean, yeah, it always just makes me so happy to hear like how our podcast just helped other people know. But hopefully it's like a start of, you know, way, I've been, I've been having this conversation with a lot of people. And the main thing that they like is like how it's not like bringing on a guru and, you know, talking about like, oh, these are the things you should do and how you should live life. Yeah. But yeah, it's, it's good. So I don't get started anywhere, mom. So let's start with you, right? So, so your stage name, I don't want to stay stage name. Your musical name is Valente. What can you explain that a little bit? What does that mean? Where does it come from? I have no idea what it means. I used to produce music under different names. And then parallel to me, starting my studies to become a language teacher, I more or less found like a job application through a small net music producer group on Facebook. I posted a few of my songs and I asked them basically, does anybody know if there's any way at all to make some money doing this? Because yeah, I don't want to sell hot dogs on the street to fatten up the money bag, you know? And one guy, he really enjoyed what I posted and he sent me a link and I applied just like you apply any job. And they got back to me, listened to a few more of my songs and when it became clear that they wanted to work with me, they sent me like a list of like, I don't know, 200 different names. And honestly, I just thought that Valente was the least succulent. I even told him that I didn't like it so I got actually. And yeah, was the one I chose. I guess it's, you know, what they say about art, you can be interpreted in so many ways. I have totally liked it on. It sounds sort of Italian maybe or I don't know if anyone was a gram from Sweden. I actually looked this up before the show. And apparently, the answer is, it sounds Italian and Portuguese, but in Portuguese it means brave and proud. Wow, really? Yeah, I mean, that's what Google is saying. Yeah. And it must be something you could just say that. Wow, that's cool. Thank you for telling me. It sounds like valent, so it makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're in Sweden right now, which by the way, it's like 8.30 pm for you. So pretty late. Yeah. Thank you for coming on, so late. Where literally in like three different time zones across like how many hours are here? You're like seven, eight hours behind. Nine hours behind. Nine hours, yeah. Oh my God. Wow. All right. Truly an international podcast now. Crazy that this is happening. For all the listeners out there are here before he came on to the podcast just now he saved like a man from dying on the street. So yeah, I hear Thomas. So I was heading out to grab some breakfast before the episode recorded and I live right across the street in the space needle. So I was going to cross the street and it's a hella busy intersection because the space needle is right there. And I was waiting for a couple minutes for the light to change. It finally changes and literally at that moment some random old lady comes up to me and is like, I'm lost. Do you know where the DMV is? And like first of all, she started explaining to me what a DMV is, which is like, I know where the DMV is, bro. Like why are you asking me otherwise? But then yeah, I had to sort of help her around and then the light changed again and I had to wait again. Hell yeah, dude. Yeah. Getting some good karma. You're good. Yeah. That's great. Your biggest weakness is your empathy towards others. Heart bleeding heart liberal. Yeah, I just went to the dentist today before this stuff. Like I'm like a little numb in one of my teeth. Yeah, it's always so annoying like doing an X-ray photo shoot for the next two or three things in your mouth. Is that like a universal thing where they make you bite this like, yeah, crystallized hard. It feels when you have to bite down on that, it feels like, oh, this is the hardest material on earth. Yeah. Yeah. It always hurts. And it's like, yeah, it's so annoying. We've come so far like we should have the technology to not do more. Yeah. How have you guys been otherwise? It's been, I've been great. I just started working today actually. I just ended like eight weeks or something like that summer break. Oh, nice. Oh, it's a paid leave over the summer. So it's pretty beautiful. That's why you become a teacher, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I just travel somewhere. I didn't travel. I mean, I guess technically I traveled abroad because I went to Denmark, but it's literally just a bridge from Malmö. So but I mean, yeah, sure. And then I just, you know, spent time with family, went on a bunch of dates with a wonderful, wonderful, beautiful woman. And yeah, it was, it was a good time. That sounds amazing. I literally, I'm taking two weeks off right now and I'm not traveling at all. I'm just like, I think this is the first time I've taken time off and just existed in a correct place. And it's very different. It's really nice. It's wonderful. Yeah. Oh, man. I hear. Yeah. So there's a lot going on with me right now. I just left my job a couple of weeks ago. So that's, that's been amazing. Like I've just been enjoying my life right now. I was in the same boat earlier where I went on leave for work last year and that was really the first time that I had ever like slowed down and just like existed and chilled. So it's really amazing like going back to that. I feel like every time like work starts up again, like I always get so demotivated and like I saw, I lose all my passion and like my hobbies and stuff. And I was wondering like am I the problem? Like am I just not like motivated and like excited in these things anymore? And then as soon as I'm out of my job, I'm like, I'm totally fine. Like I have so much energy and just so much life. So I've just been enjoying like getting back into things, like getting back to the good routine, doing photography again, stuff, writing a lot, stuff like that. So living my best life right now. Well that sounds good. It's also speaking of balance and brave and all that. I think it's really brave to decide to leave your job throwing yourself into the unknown. That's brave. The good thing is like I got a pretty nice severance deal like when I left. So I have like a couple of months of savings like six to eight months. So it's not too scary right now. I think things worked out really nice. Yeah, it's always a little terrifying to just stir yourself into the unknown regardless. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm following a year's footsteps. Serious? Riding jobs, rescuing old ladies. Yeah, literally all of it. The whole the Rocha gang. Yeah, by the time this episode comes out, I will be unemployed as well. Probably. All right. All right, man. Your manager is going to see this episode and fire you. No, that would be nice. I know. I will. Yeah. Is there like a, I mean, regardless of what kind of work you do, because you're both in the States, right? Yeah. Is there some sort of law which guarantees you a certain amount of weeks of vacation every year and then you have to sort of like plan it with your boss or do they actually there is not. It depends on the company. So a lot of companies they give you like a set amount of PTO days. And so actually like if you quit and you haven't ate your like PTO days, then they'll pay that out to you. No. But there's a catch here that a lot of companies are now doing unlimited PTO, which sounds fantastic. But then two things a lot of people don't take time off because there's no set amount of days to take off. And so it just becomes like very team dependent, culture dependent. And the second thing is when you quit or when you get fired, they don't have to pay you out for PTO days that you haven't used because it's unlimited. So American corporations, it's just a get you in the door kind of thing. Yeah. Well, American corporations are always innovating on new ways to exploit you. I've been doing well otherwise. PT's been going well. I'm doing a bunch of lateral movement. Nice. Would like to get back to playing soccer soon, maybe another month or so. But yeah, it's been that a lot of big changes coming, coming back to New York and busy busy. And I spend the rest of my time trying to convince a here to move to New York. So that's been going on as well. The eternal struggle for me, whether or not to just pull the trigger. I think you should just do it, man. Even though I basically know nothing about you. Just do it. Sounds like, yeah, why not? Yeah, I asked myself the same question. You know, on the subject of helping people and stuff like I made a post on Reddit just asking like, hey, like I'm about to take a break from my corporate job. Like, I want to like, you know, volunteer in the community, like take classes, like kind of stuff, like what are some of my ideas. And so people gave me a lot of cool ideas actually, and links and stuff. There was one guy who was like, maybe you should volunteer your money to people who aren't getting a job because right now, like, you know, a lot of people don't have jobs. And it's like a hard to get one, especially in tech and some other industries. So it just like makes you think like obviously like obviously I have privilege to be in this position. I did work for it. I made smart decisions throughout my life, but it's also like just luck, right? And just like, how do you navigate that? I mean, do you just ignore things like that? Like obviously like, I can't give up my, you know, whatever I've made like that, you know, to just give it out to people because obviously like I have plans for myself in my future and the people I care about. And so I'm also like playing with the cards that I've been dealt with. It just just how do you like bring yourself to peace when there's so much, you know, suffering around you in the world? It's like, it just feels selfish as well. So I just, I don't know, it's just something I haven't quite figured out how to think about. Yeah. I think if you open that box, it's hard to close it again because where does that end? Yeah. When there's like total peace and total equality and no, as a no, no famine, nothing, you can always find a reason to be to self up about your own privilege. But yeah, it's difficult. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's difficult. Of course it is. I always say there's such a fine line between like survivors guilt in a savior complex where it's like on one hand, I feel so blessed to like have this privilege and to have all of these great things in my life. But at the same time, it's almost like kind of conceded to see it all as like waiting on you where it's like, I can't solve the world's problems, right? I can give up all of my wealth and all the good things in my life. And that's not going to push the border of all the world's problems and interest, right? I sort of feel like when Michael Jackson sang, if you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make a change. And that's one, that's one hell of a line, man. And I think if you do that and you love the people close to you and you, I mean like superhero, superhero, saving only the need and you, you're kind to people that you meet and you're generous with your resources. Not to say you have to sacrifice yourself doing it. I mean, if you walk through life like that, then I truly believe that you're making a huge difference. Yeah. I mean, just the fact that you guys, I don't know how many conversations were had before you actually decided to record a podcast and then you made an episode about heartbreak. And I mean, and you changed a dude across the world, you know, and here we are. You can ask, you can, you can really change the world in a small ways, I believe. Just because you're not giving up all of your possessions doesn't mean you're not helping and being kind. Yeah. And that's it. You're ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. And that's it for today's episode. Yep. That's all we needed to say. Like you have had a really interesting life like ever since the beginning, just growing up. Why don't you tell us a bit about it? Sure. I guess you could say I was born into a commune, sort of like a hippie hybrid. Everybody knows each other, but live in their own apartment, still kind of deal. And that gave me a very nuanced perspective on culture and people, humans, relationships, sharing, caring, all of that. So I always felt a little bit different from like the kids in my school. And sometimes I was even teased for it, you know, because I came from the the the weird house sort of, but it was great. I have a lot of fond childhood memories from that time. I remember, for example, as a kid after breakfast, I could just leave my apartment and go to my neighbors and tell them that I hadn't had breakfast yet. So I just went on like a breakfast tour and had breakfast at different neighbors. And you know, some people were Swedish, some people were from Chile, some people were Iranian, some people were from like a Bosnia or so it was just really was a fun time. And I think it gave me a lot of sense of goodness. Like people are good, you know, in the world. It's very similar to like how a lot of like extended families are, you know, really big families that live together in India, you know, your dad's brother and your dad's brothers, wife and cousin. And just they all live together and you can just go around on a food tour as a kid and get your belly's whole multiple times a day. It's interesting. I feel like we don't see that at all in the States. It's very nuclear. Yeah. It's very nuclear family in Sweden as well. Oh, yeah. So this is the exception. There is not the rule. Do you feel like growing up in that environment changed your relationship to your parents at all? Because like are you living in a growing up in a commune is like much more natural? Like in early like human civilizations, like everyone was raised communally, right? Yeah. It takes a village to raise a child. That would affect like my relationship to my parents would be completely different if I grew up like an environment like that. So I'm just curious. I mean, sure, every child is dependent on their parents, but I always felt very safe and taken care of by all older people around me. And I don't mean just grownups. It could be like say I was maybe five and you know, the teenagers of the place could play with me or watch me if my parents had to do something where I couldn't attend or you name it, you know. But then I guess like a side note, I also had cancer as a very young child. So that might have or may have affected the way people like treated me, you know. So I might have come across as more fragile than the other kids. So maybe I got a little more love, I don't know. So you know, growing up in a commune, having some of these like childish struggles, is that something that you pull from when you make music, like when you're creating art? Sometimes the commune was just booming with creativity from a lot of different people. You had people who played music and people made pottery and people were painters or bakers. And there was just always a lot of creating going on. So I think that for sure is a part of my creative process. Maybe not. It might not be like in the forefront of the process, not something I consciously think about, but I definitely believe that it's shaped me in ways where it's with me for sure. I guess doubling back to something you mentioned though, like having cancer as a child, like that's absolutely crazy. I must imagine, I'm so glad you're still with us and I have to imagine that I must have really impacted your perspective on things as a child, right? Going through something like that. Yeah, this is something that I sort of come back to again and again as an adult. I see how it still lingers in who I am today and the things I find difficult today. And that for sure affected me as a child as well. I believe that I had a very different framework than other kids. I think if you don't go through anything like that as a young child, I mean, it's a sort of trauma, right? Life in itself is just beautiful and very innocent as a child and the world is just a big oyster and you're just very curious and everything's magical and everything's new, everything's fresh, everything's happening for the first time. And yeah, spending hours upon hours and days upon days and weeks upon weeks in hospitals in and out and having to take a lot of medications and your hair falls out and you have to, I don't know what that's called in English, but you sort of, you go through an operation and then you have like a little application is probably the wrong word here. But basically, I had to take so many different medications that they didn't want to give me like shot after shot after shot. So I just had a tube directly into my throat like the main artery here on my right side. So they could just like shoot me up with meds without having to penetrate me with a needle. Yeah. And I called. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. And I mean, then you went when you actually do meet other children, they're just very happy and carefree and you know, you're just like, wait, you're not suffering like what the thing. You know, but I also think I was, I was young enough to not realize what was actually happening. But then again, when you're that young, you're just very susceptible to everything in your surroundings, right? So if you're surrounded by, let's say, a lot of doctors and worried people and stuff like that, not to sound too woo, but all of that energy in the room, you pick up on that. You don't have the tools to cognitively put it into words to other people or to yourself for stuff like that, but your, yeah, your body remembers for sure. So hard times. Yeah. I mean, like, literally here, like if you're in a toxic work environment for a few months, like, you're all like, shambles. So like I can imagine this is way more worse than that. Just a smidge. Yeah. Literally. But how do you, I guess, how do you, how do you feel about all that now? Is it something that you think about and it feels, feels you with, you know, grief or I don't know, just how do you, obviously it's a part of who you are at this point? How do you think about it? Even before that, before how you think about it now, like how did, how did it feel back then? Like I must imagine you must have felt like very different or like very alienated from like other kids around you, right? Did they look at you any different? I was always very open about the fact that I had cancer. You can't see that on the webcam here, but on my right side, on my neck here, I have a scar from the IV or whatever. It's called C.A.V.C.O. in Swedish so that would be CVK. I don't know, maybe that's universal, universal, I don't know. And when you got to the age where kids started to realize that you could kiss other people or make, it's so good, Marke. I don't think suction markets, right? Like if you, if you kiss, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so everyone always thought that I had a hiki, you know? So I could get, you know, they stared at me and they laughed or they were just pointing and stuff like that. And some of them point blank asked me what it was. And I just straight up told them that, well, I had cancer and this and that and this and that. And in that sense, I think they probably perceived me as different than them. I've always been very, very introspective. I think I would have been, even if I didn't go through the cancer, but from a very young age when I started to realize what almost happened, you know, that I almost didn't make it, I started to think a lot about death and dying. And when you think about dying and death, you have to think about existing and living as well. And that sort of puts this very young kid in a position where he had a very young age starts to think about the questions that nobody seemingly through the history of mankind has ever actually found an answer to and that was very, very overwhelming at times. Yeah, that question is like, that's like, I don't know, I feel like I struggled with that a little bit in my own way over the years. Oh, yeah. I should know death. Like I, I mean, my growing up, when I was young, my mom had cancer. And so it just made me like, I don't know, think about it a lot. And it would make me pretty obviously very different than New York's parents, but it would make me question death, meaning of it, meaning of life. Just, I know, just, I think that's mostly more than anything. I just, like you said, I didn't really have the tools to go about digging around and dissecting it at all. So it was just like, fill me with fear. Yeah. And what are you talking about? Like eight, nine. Yeah, yeah. For sure. And so since then, it's just been kind of like that. And I don't think that really changed. It just made me an anxious person and just really trying to optimize every single moment in my life. Yeah. Looking for control. Looking for yes control. Yeah. And so, but I don't think it really changed until a couple years ago. And I started listening to learning a little bit more about like spiritual stuff, like how we approach death itself. Because I think, I think in general in the Western world, like we're really poor about the way that we approach it. Yeah. Like just the way that we approach it. There is. It's something, it's a subject that you don't go near. Yeah. It's just like people are, people are really uncomfortable talking about the fact that we're all dying at the end of this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I read this one book actually called Being Mortal. Yeah. And it was describing the way we approach like end of life care and how like just terrible it is and how much it leads to. And it's really, really opened my eyes about like where we're going wrong. And I think since then, I think I've come to terms with that a lot better. Do you still feel like you, they may be in relationships or in your work environment or in friendships? Do you still feel like you're looking for a sense of control? Because I do help me. I mean, at least for me, I definitely still feel that way. I had a pretty similar experience, not with cancer, but I had a kind of like a rough childhood. So I definitely spent a lot of time thinking about death. Like I remember in elementary school like being afraid of like falling asleep because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up in the morning. Well, and so I would just try to like stay up because I was so terrified like death. And I definitely still struggle with that a lot. I would not say it's become that much easier for me. Like I am very terrified of dying and like trying to make the most of the time that I still have like a care a lot about my health and stuff because I want as much time as I can. I've gotten slightly better at least at accepting like that I can't control everything. Like I'm just going to lose out on my time even more if I try to resist things instead of just letting things be what they are and sort of just going along with it and making it. But I can out of it. But it is definitely hard to like give up sometimes when it's like everything feels so important because this times feel so limited and finite. So yeah. I was just going to ask the both of you and maybe myself, would you actually want total control? Would anything be of value if you had total control? Not really. I think there's so many factors out there. There's no way to actually control everything. You're just going to have more and more neurotic about the way you go about things and more and more miserable. Like there's a flow of things and you just have to help out with it. Like you control what you can. And I don't know like you said, like I definitely think I was in that headspace where like I wanted to control. I wanted to control the outcome of my last relationship but for a variety of reasons like that had to break and like that completely broke me. And since then like I feel like I'm a lot better about letting go. Yeah. Being okay with whatever happens and I'm more content. Yeah. I'm practicing that right now with the wonderful human being that I'm dating. She is good to me in a way that I haven't really experienced before. And that can also make me very afraid to lose it. And I catch myself from time to time spiraling in my thoughts and becoming afraid even though she's really doing everything she can to make me feel safe and secure. And it's normal to not always be on the same page or miscommunications can happen and all that stuff. I'm trying to approach the thing as an opportunity for me to practice letting go of control and loving another human being. The way she is not the way you know because it's difficult to not project. Like your idea of like you meet you meet someone you fall in love. And then you have like this you know I wouldn't say perfect but you have an idea of what you want or who you would want your person to be. And you sort of forget that you met a human being and we're all flawed. And then you carry this like neuroticism on your inside for various reasons and you just try to control everything. And it just yeah like I said before do you even want total control? It's hard man. It's difficult. Yeah. It's brilliant. Yeah. And it's so like it's all so crazy to me and retrospect because it's like obviously like if someone's not like if someone doesn't fit who you need in your life like it's obviously better for the both of you like if you go your separate ways and you find that person like who does fit better together with you. But I feel like there's so much it just feels so significant losing that person because it's almost like I mean there is this like interplay between like who you want them to be and also like the reality of who they are and all of these like beautiful things they bring into your life. And it's hard sometimes to accept that those two things are not always reconcilable and you can't have everything and sometimes you have to be okay with letting go. And those two things are also changing all the time. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And then on top of everything you know once you open that door to your algorithm there's just like dating and relationship advice. Oh my god. And it's just you know you can become at the end of the day it's hard to navigate through like what's your emotions? What actually from something you heard someone say or you feel like there's a lot of things you should out there or but then you forget to be present in the meeting with this other person that's actually take place that you're actually experiencing in the now. I'm really trying to to be with her and not be with the version of her that books me in my mind. But yeah, I know she's going to listen to this. So I just want to say you're incredible. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. And like exactly like you're saying it's like just seeing that person for who they are. Sometimes you can get so wrapped up in your idea of someone that you even miss out on so many things that are beautiful about them or that are great about them because they aren't something you're looking for. And if you let yourself see them then you'll finally see those things clearly. And I think like going back to what you were asking about like would you really want control over everything? That's really why I wouldn't because I feel like there's so many things that have fallen into my life that are like beautiful and valuable that I never would have considered if I had control over everything. That element of like spontaneity and just like letting things fall into your life and seeing them for what they are. You know, speaking of spontaneity maybe you should move to New York. Oh no. The pressure. You know, face the non-control and stuff at all. That's where the God. If we start getting comments on every episode, when are you moving to New York? Too much pressure. You should start hitching. Have you ever hitched a ride from someone just like on the road just like you know with the thumbs up like okay that's such a crazy experience. Is that even something people do anymore? I mean speaking of having to let go of control right? I mean that person could be anybody. Yeah. Yeah, you could end up kidnapped. I tried to do it once after a music first school but it didn't work. So I have no experience. And now the older I get and the more I know the less I want to hitch with strange people. Where about you guys? Have you ever done that? No. I think yeah, that would be too much. Honestly, I feel like a festival would be one of the best times to do that. I feel like that would be the most trusting of that crowd. I don't know, dude. I don't trust any of those people. So then we talked a lot about your childhood and stuff. I wanted to talk about your music that you create a little bit more. I asked about a few cool inspirations from your childhood struggles and living in a commune and stuff. And you said maybe a little bit, it's not a forefront. So what do you pull? Where does your inspiration come from? It could be anything, I guess. I would say that life needs to happen for a while in order for me to have something to express. I work with music in a professional sense. And I know that, let's say there's a deadline in two months, right? And I have to make, let's say, four songs or four tracks. And one or two tracks, it just sort of flies by. I end up in a state of flow where I forget myself and I'm just a tangent here. I used to think that artists or creative people who said stuff like, oh, I don't know where it comes from. I guess I'm just channeling from the universe. I used to cringe so hard at those people, but I am one of those people now. That's exactly what that feels like. Yeah. Which is very hard to explain to someone who has an experience at themselves. Life needs to happen for a while. Stuff needs to happen. Emotions need to come and go. And then when it's time to get into the creative process, I usually end up making just a lot of different court progressions or melodies. And then one of these court progressions or one of these melodies will just sort of snap mean to a trans. And it just happens. Take a flow state. Yeah. And then it's really looking to get into the flow state. And in order to do that, I always need a trigger of some kind. And it can be just hearing the background music of like if I'm doom scrolling, it can be a clip where I hear a certain baseline or piano court progression. And then it just, it doesn't really end the way I hear it in my head. And then it sort of just, you know, spins out there. Or it could be listening to new music or old music. Or just, I guess I could say something cringey like the sound of the washing machine. You know, I mean, yeah, it could honestly come from anywhere, I guess you could say. I'm just trying to be receptive to the signals of the universe. I guess I have two things, right? Like one is like your music has got this like very like, it feels very ethereal, very full, very mature, very calming. It kind of reminds me of this like arc that a lot of people go through. You know, as a kid, you grow up thinking, okay, nothing matters. But unless you grow up with like very anxious parents, and then because then you're like, oh shit, everything matters. And then you're just like crazy about it. And at some point people, kids become like a very like, broody and depressed, you know, like entertainers years. Oh, yes. It's a very dark sobering like. Oh, yeah. It's me. I'm kids. I'm kids as well. And then eventually that turns into like a very peaceful like, oh, nothing matters. Um, and I feel like your music gives me the vibe of someone who's like gone through that whole process and like you've made a past that are. He has. Yeah. That's very impressively accurate. I mean, if you had to summarize my subjective experience of becoming a human being, then that's a good, good take on it. Yeah. Well, I feel like I feel like that might also be true because that's true for a lot of people. Honestly, honestly, I think it's probably the most common thing, but we live in a society where that's just not a boxy open because you want to fit in. It has gotten a lot better. I'd say the last maybe five to 10 years, but I remember for a while when social media was new, yes, listeners. I'm that old. I'm 34. So were you on my space? I do. Yeah. Yeah, I have my space was was a pretty cool. I was going to say that at the beginning when everything was that new and new social media's were just, you know, we're popping up basically every other week. It was all about connecting people and talking about mental health and wellness and mindfulness and all that that just came way later. Way later. And I mean, I think people have been suffering regardless for even way, way before my time. I think that's just a part of being human, finding peace and suffering. And I think, you know, I think a lot about my students that I teach and I try to give them a sense of peace if I can, but I also think that they're too young to really take it aboard. You know, I plan seeds that will make sense in like 10 years for them. Yeah. Something like that. But I cannot imagine growing up in a world, I mean, in the same world that they do where everything on social media is just about being super successful or super good looking, more fit or liked by everyone or I mean, talk about anxiety, man. And if you express that anxiety at that age, like social suicide almost, I mean, I know I know I'm generalizing a bit here, but you know, yeah, I think what we lose out on is like just the chance to just be who you are in that moment without any like judgments, any like judgments, any like ideals of what one should be to be cool. You already get enough of that from school and then social media just like takes it to a crazy level. And definitely something I've been learning to do more is letting myself be who I am instead of trying to force myself to be something that I think I should be. Yeah, that's good. So creativity wise, right? Like obviously like you grew up in a commune and you said there are a lot of creative people there. So I think like in some way like the creative process is kind of second nature to you. It just kind of happens on its own. I mean, I wouldn't say I grew up in the most creative environment. And it's something I like being creative. It's something I struggle with where it's like a lot of times it just feels wrong to be creative unless it's like, like even if I have like for example, right? Like I'll be if I'm taking a day off and like I'm nothing to do. Like I'll keep doing other things throughout the day other than like sit down and do what I want to do like be creative, you know, work on some music or write a script or something until it's like until it's like 10 p.m. at night or 11 p.m. at night. And that's when like suddenly I'm creative and like all these ideas and this willingness to sit down till 2 a.m. 3 a.m. to do things and it's like, God damn it. Why can I just do this in the day? I feel like I struggle with that process a little bit. Do you think that ties into the sense of like the need for control that things need to be for sure? Yeah, for sure. For sure. 100% I need to set up a million things before I can sit down and be creative. Yeah, that's for sure something that I guess comes in the way. If you do sit down before everything is sorted, do you feel guilty? I feel guilty. No, I just feel anxious. Yeah, I just feel like I can't do something else. What's the core of that anxiousness? Guilty? Yeah, maybe it's guilt. Yeah, it's like guilt, a lack of like optimizing my time. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think really it's about reframing and not seeing that as like a loss of time, but as seeing that as almost something to be optimized, like as like a form of productivity and not something where you're like slacking, right? Because like what's really happening, like why are you getting that creative burst at the end of the day is because mentally you're finally settled in the place where you think like, okay, I don't have to do anything anymore. I don't have to worry about anything. So your mind finally has a space that it needs to truly be creative and like flow and like explore different ideas. And at least for me, what I find is that I just need to like structure my time and like just tell myself like, okay, I'm going to spend two hours like today, like just focusing on my creative work. And when I have that time settled and I know like there's nothing else I need to do, like this is what I want to focus on, that's what like, that's when I have like the mental space that I need to be creative. Yeah, that makes sense. You know what? Also like the other thing is like the outcomes, the outcomes are just so like for a lot of other tasks, right? You know, I need to set up an appointment. I need to go buy this thing. I need to move this. I need to, you know, invest this money to where like whatever it might be, right? The outcome is very like tangible and like, immidiate. But with creativity, it's like I could sit there for two hours and nothing good come out of it at all. And so it just feels like, and so I guess, yeah, you're right. I feel guilty doing that because like I know that this might be a complete waste of time. It's not a waste of time, obviously. Well, what would it be? I was like, yeah, I mean, you're investing in life, aren't you? Right? Yeah. And I feel like there's so many times where I think I'm wasting my time, but then I realize afterwards like, okay, those two hours that I gave myself to like, like work on something, maybe I spent that time like processing something emotionally or like I just like my head wandered somewhere else, but it turns out I really still didn't mean that time. Like I had to get past that block in order to engage creatively. So I think that's like another thing that I've also been working on is like reframing that as like a loss to like unnecessary stuff in the process. So yeah, what you said, Devam, about the outcome being very tangible, like you get the results immediately. Do you ever, because I know I can struggle with this. Do you ever, or this, I mean, this question is for the both of you or anyone who's listening. You think that maybe subconsciously you're afraid that let's say you do sit down before everything else is sorted. And if nothing comes of it, it's wrong because there was no result. Like you said, and then it feels like a waste of time. Yeah, because then at the end of that, I will have, maybe I don't have an outcome for that process. And I still have all those things that I need to do. So it's just like complete failure. Yeah, but so if we just like hone in on the fact that you're existing as a human being, all of those outcomes that you sort on a day-to-day basis, what does that actually, what, I mean, what does that mean to you? What does that give you? How important, I mean, sure, you have to pay rent and stuff like that, but just for the sake of philosophy here. If you had to compare that to messing around on the piano or the guitar for two hours or whatever, and maybe making the world's greatest song that nobody ever gets to hear, or maybe everyone gets to hear it, or maybe you just learn a new chord progression, or maybe, I don't know, maybe nothing happens. Yeah. Compared to taking out a trash, cooking, cleaning, calling that, doing that, booking that. Yeah, I mean, it just feels like, I guess it just comes back to this thing about like optimizing life and like getting as far as you can with all the things you want. I'm going full shrink mode now. Was there a lot of time? Let's do it. Was there a lot of time optimizing in your household growing up? Yes. There was. Yes. So much time. This is how my friends grew up to it. Like, the moment we come back from a trip, all of our suitcases are immediately unpacked. Everything is put away. All the dishes are done. Like just everything, everything, like, there is no chill without, if there's a task to be done, there's no chill that happens. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, could be. So, but it's an interesting example that you just gave us coming back from a trip. So during the trip, was there chill? You know, I think it's changed now, but growing up, man, like it was like, it was like, we have to see like as many places. And it was just a amount of time possible. Yes. So optimizing chill. Yeah. So optimizing. Yeah. Like literally, we would hop like every day, we'd be in a different place because we'd see this. It's like, bro, we would never go back on. I grew up. I grew up. I've never, like, for the first 23 years of my life, I've never watched a TV show twice. I've never watched a movie twice after I was like six or seven years old. So for the first 23 years of your life, you only masturbated one time. You know, he would have to find different videos every time. Optimize something like that. Something like that. Yeah. All right. It was a way of life, man. I don't know. I mean, yeah. And subconsciously, what does that teach you? It teaches you that you can't just be, you know, just existing is frowned upon. I mean, yeah, no wonder you feel guilty. Huh? And you figured out my. I hear you. I go to do him next. I was going to say I have a very similar thing where like my parents would, it's like we would visit Europe for two weeks and it was like every two days we were going to a new country. It's like no time to actually like soak anything in. I mean, honestly, just, are you aware of the, it's not a comedy, but it's a fictional character, a bull named Ferdinand? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know who just, he's like the strongest bull of them all, but he doesn't want to fight. He's very peaceful and he'd rather just sit on the retreat and smell the flowers. I think that's a very wonderful way of being. You know, obviously very privileged, but if you can just be, I think that's a very good way to spend your time. Yeah. I remember growing up when a lot of kids would enjoy, you know, playing like, I mean, playing with sticks sounds so trivial, but you know, I mean, I don't know. I don't know the English words for all these like plays who do as a child, but you can just make it up in your own head, right? I could just, I remember, let's say it's just a sunny day, the wind's blowing, the windows open and I could just lay on the bed and be like, why doesn't everybody just lay on the bed? This is the greatest thing ever. Just doing absolutely nothing with my time. Yeah. And then you grow up and you have bills today. Yeah, I feel like I've just started getting back in touch with that part of myself where it's like, there's so much joy and like just lying down like in the grass and just allowing myself to be there and just soaking in all the smells and the feelings and the sweetness of just existing, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It takes time to, you know, fully integrate into your life, but I feel like I'm on the right path. So it'll have to. Yeah. And it's like you said before, everything is always changing. I think, I think it can also be very dangerous to feel like, oh, I found this new thing I want to integrate. So now I have to do that all the time. To my eyes. Yeah, exactly. Be careful of the optimizing classic. Yeah. Am I lying in bed enough? Should I be spending more time on my day lying in bed? I didn't just exist today. Yeah. 3 p.m. The 3.45 p.m. Just be here. Was there any of the questions that you wanted to go through or any other? I think the thing, the 20 section I see is the 20 section is a whole episode. No, maybe we say I'll come back for that one. Yeah. Oh my God. To the people listening. If you want me to come back and give me and give me some encouragement in the comments, you know, yes. Show some love. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please, we need another interview with this man. Yeah, it's all down to the feedback. Okay, if there's no second episode. If we don't get 100 likes on our posts, it's all very good. But I guess, yeah, I guess in that case, we're ending nearing the end of our time. And thank you so much for coming. Guys, like go, go look, go look, go look, go look, go on to out on Spotify, Apple, wherever his music is really, really good. And you know, you could just honestly, you could lay out on your balcony on a chair and with a join and just play with you and just exist. You know, we're talking about existing. This is the perfect music to exist to. So go do that. That's a pull quote. This is perfect music to exist to. Yeah, I'll try. I'll try to make something short and sweet for this episode. Beautiful. That would be amazing. Yeah. Do you have anything you want to plug? Yeah, it's it's a ballante, ballante, ballante everywhere. I guess everywhere you can stream, if you're curious. And yeah, listen, relax, have a good time. Some tracks are more meditative. Other tracks are more soft house or lawn chouse or deep house. So it's, yeah, it varies a lot. One question before I leave you. How is your, how is your music changing? Like is it like, what, what should we expect from you in the future? Oh, wow. I have no idea. All right. I mean, you can expect music. That's, yeah, you can expect more. But there's no plan. There's no roadmap, nothing like that. It just depends. I see it's better that way. Just whatever comes. Yeah. It's more surprising. You don't know what you're going to get. It's perfect. All right, people, take the opportunity and tell the people close to you that you love them. Don't wait.
