Oh man, I'm gonna have to cut this up today. Oh no. Today. April, we have a new guest joining our rotation today. One of my friends from college. Gara is here with us. She is actually one of my earliest friends from college. I think we met during orientation. Literally the first day. She is extremely smart. She's very driven, passionate. Also one of the most humble and relatable people out there. And, um, Oh, she has a fantastic voice, by the way. She'd hear her sing someday. Um, I think do you have anything on Spotify, Gara? I do, but I don't know if I'm like proud enough of it to share right now. All right. Well, we'll plug it when you're comfortable. But she's also one to call you out on your shit, which I always appreciate. We're real friends. And she's currently, she's currently trailblazing her way through medical school and is such an inspiration. She also has played a huge role in giving me the confidence to start to show solo traveling, which I'm so grateful for. So welcome, Gara. I'm so glad to be here. That's also sweet of you too. Thank you. All right. So how have you guys been? Have you been doing? Say a name, Brad. It gets confused. Sure. They will. Why don't you start? Oh, man. Okay. I've been doing good. Today, I'll tell you about today. Today was a great day. It is 75 degrees in New York. Fantastic sunny day. I woke up and one of my friends was throwing a coffee bar. Oh, so shout out average coffee, AVG coffee in New York. They have seasonal events. So if you get invited to them, you're lucky. I'll just say that. And then I went to Soho, because I just felt like I could use some retail therapy. And so I went to Soho and I walked into Zara and I bought $250 worth of clothes, which I've something I've never done before actually. So I did that. And then I came home and I got some bond meat and I sat in the park and I ate it. And now I'm here. How are you guys? Brad, look, you feel like I'm on exactly the same wavelength. I've also been going on a shopping spree and I'm planning on hitting up Zara tomorrow. So it's literally going to be me. Yeah. I'm surprised you haven't done that before, spending that much. It's a necessity. In one go? No. At one store in one go. No, I'm okay. At one store, I guess. Me. Me. That's a little different. But feel like it leads for me. Like I always like just binge by clothes. So I won't buy anything for like months and spend like $300. Then spending too much money in general. We're not going to do that. Gora, how are you? I'm good. I just had a big change in my schedule. So now I have Saturday and Sundays off, which has been huge. So today I just got to take care of like tasks and stuff and sleep in and do my laundry and meal prep and all those things, which was very centering. But then yesterday I was like hanging out with friends and doing all that stuff. So a good balance, a good balance weekend. Are you in residency or? No, I'm in my third year of med school and you basically like work in the hospital full time. Oh, okay. One of my like best friends, Karthik, like he's also going through the same thing right now. But I didn't realize it was that intense where it's like you're working weekends and stuff. Even while you're still in that school, that's crazy. Oh, my God. Yeah, it's like my schedule before this was like six days a week. Oh, my God. And so now I'm just like Monday through Friday, which has been very relieving for sure. Yeah. Yeah. They really exploit the fuck out of y'all before they start paying you. No, I know when they have us pay tuition too, which is like the craziest part of the day. Yeah. I've been in pretty good place recently, which I'm happy about. I feel like things have I mentioned last time things have been kind of like rough for me, like a little up in the air, just growing things kind of. And I feel like I'm slowly on my way out of that is a long way to go. But I'm definitely like feel better than I have in a long while. So yeah. Is something about the spring, man. Yeah. So whether it's not shit. So it's not depressing all the time. How is Seattle is it sunny? Right now it's depressing as fuck like it's literally like gray and cloudy outside, but there have definitely been like a lot of good days like that. Yeah, like when even on 420, like it was a bit cloudy, but like it was just good weather, good climate. It's chilling out in the park. Annual holiday for 20. Yes. West Coast holiday. Washington Square Park was industry this year. Like the host. Yeah, I don't know. Everyone in New York was high. It was wild. Trying to get including me. But yeah. All right. So for this week's episode, we're going to be doing a follow up on breakups. Just see how everyone's been doing. And Gora, since you weren't here for the last episode, you know, really bad scheduling conflict. I guess why don't you like get into it a bit and just like, I guess give us some understanding how it would happen. Yeah. So I, like I guess my, I started dating my ex boyfriend. Literally also like met during orientation of college and started dating like day three of undergrad, probably. And then we're together all four years of college and broke up. Like a month after we graduated. Like on the phone, you know, we weren't living in the same city. And then I haven't seen him since. But very, yeah, the very broad overview is we dated for all of college broke up after. Didn't talk for a while and then have since kind of. We're on good terms with each other kind of and talk sometimes. And then kind of have both dated since like other people sense and yeah. So that makes two of us in a here you, you, you with your smug, you know, I think you're protecting. Yeah. Okay. You don't know how easy you have it, man. I'm just, I'm just telling you, your life has been very easy. Okay. I feel like I feel like I feel like I feel bad about even responding because like what am I going to say other than rub more salt in the language. It's okay. They're other, they're other issues. Yes. Don't worry about the balance of that balance. I'll take this shit sweet second. Did you mention this but like how long were you guys dating for? So for all four years of college then? Yeah, we dated for all four years of college and then broke up in the summer of 2021. And then actually I guess I didn't mention earlier, but I started dating somebody else seriously. Like pretty soon after and then have since broken up with that person as well. So I guess two different kind of breakups to talk about. For your first relationship. Like was it something that I guess like when it ended like was it something you were kind of expecting or like did it come out of nowhere? Yeah, it was one of those things I think where we both for a couple for a few months, if not longer, kind of both new in the back of our heads that like we maybe weren't in the best place for each other or like the best people for each other at that point in our lives anymore. I think it was like I had this idea that like it might be coming but like didn't really want to accept it or like. But then kind of a lot of changes happened with ending or graduating college and moving different places and all sorts of stuff was shifting. And so I think it was actually I initiated the breakup. And so it gets in that way like wasn't necessarily like blindsided, but I think a lot of different factors ended up playing in that I didn't think about when we had graduated college because when we did graduate and move away, we were still dating and it was only a month after that we broke up. So it wasn't the timeline that I would have expected, but I think the sense was kind of there. Yeah, was it pretty mutual like on both sides like you knew kind of what was coming. I think I think we both knew and like somebody had to initiate it and I don't think either of us really wanted to want it to happen, but it was more of that cerebral like this is probably with best for us and it was definitely harder to accept I think for him as well to just like holding on to something that we were in for so long, but it was more or less mutual. Okay, I got you. Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, even if you know like kind of in the back of your mind that something's not good. I mean, it's hard to like pull that trigger and kind of I mean you're not throwing away for years, but I can imagine like it probably feels like that loss. It's hard to like initiate something like that. Yeah, so was it do you feel like like the distance was like the major part of it or do you feel like that was more something that just like again like sort of like made those issues that you said were in the back of your mind more prominent. I think more the latter because we started dating super young like we were both just out of high school and we both grew a lot over the four years of college and change a lot as people and I think we've been kind of used to distance honestly because summer is in college. We weren't seeing each other and then COVID happened in the third year so we didn't see each other for a while. So like a good distance, a good portion of our relationship was long distance anyway, so I wouldn't say that that was like the driving factor. But I think just getting older and changing his people and kind of realizing that there were we had different needs and different things that we wanted out of a relationship as we matured. Like little things like that and then you know, yeah, there were other things kind of that played into it all, but just like little by little, you know. I guess you. So I guess like immediately afterwards like after you initiated the breakup, like what was your reaction really? I guess in the sense of like, yeah, like how did you react? How did you cope emotionally? Like I guess like, yeah, like just sort of like what was like that whole process been of like coming to terms with that and I guess like I imagine now like you have your process more and you had more time to sit with it. Yeah, I think well actually I think it's interesting because the thoughts I kind of been brewing for a while and then later on I kind of came to find out that there was some things that happened in the relationship that maybe like that made me lose trust a little bit. And so I think that was also really what pushed me to be like, okay, I need to kind of move forward from this. And so there was the feeling of hurt was both and like grief of just morning, the lots of the relationship, but it was also like hurt from these things that had happened and anger towards him for these things that had happened as well. So it was very confusing. I think for a while it wasn't super clear cut. I think since I've come to terms with it definitely and for the most part don't feel like strongly emotionally one way or another like negatively or positively about it. But I definitely do think that there's still times in my life where I feel the impacts of the way that that relationship ended. Have you ever felt like, have you ever felt a moment where you're like, oh yes, I've healed. Has that ever happened? I wouldn't say like 100%. There's never been like a, oh yeah, I'm done. Like I've reached the next level. But there's definitely times where I'm like, I've improved. Like I'm healing and these things may have bothered me before or like might have weighed on me more before, but a year later, two years later, those like little things don't affect me quite as much. And so like little benchmarks. I'm just curious. So like how do you feel like your second relationship back through into like the healing process for the first and I guess like, yeah, just like same for that. Like I guess like talk us through a little bit of what happened there. Yeah, so after kind of right after my first breakup or like during my first breakup, I was moving to New York and starting a job after college. In some ways that was helpful because I was just like all these new people and new things to do and just like living in this new very young city. It was easy to kind of have distractions and not think about it so much. And I wasn't really in the same environment that I had been when we broke up at all. So it kind of allowed me to kind of separate or compartmentalize a little bit. And so I had like wanted to live in New York my whole life. And so when I was when I got there, I was basically just like, I'm not going to let this breakup ruin my experience here. I know it's a finite amount of time. And so I basically kind of started dating pretty soon, just like casually dating and going on dates pretty soon after because I also didn't know anybody in the city at that time. And like needed something to do with my evenings. And so yeah, and it kind of very casually dating for a while. And then kind of like started seeing somebody and fell into this situation ship basically for lack of better words. And it was one of those things where I knew that like mentally I wasn't at a place where I had healed enough from my last relationship that I could truly commit to somebody else and be present and like a relationship in that way, but also like did really hit it off with this person and wanted to keep spending time with them. And so it was definitely a weird situation of like me communicating those things and being very upfront about it. But then this the he was very much also like that's fine. And I just kind of want to spend time with you in whatever way that is. And so kind of had this basically like six, nine month long situation ship thing while I was living there. And the following June, so June of 2022, I was moving to Seattle for med school. And so then it kind of became this question of like, or do we just stop seeing each other now or like do try a long distance thing and we were never like we weren't exclusive still. And so kind of in that whole moving drama again of like what do I do now. I kind of was just like, all right, it's been a year now and I feel like I've spent so much time with this person, like my second boyfriend. That maybe I can commit in that way, like maybe I've gotten to a point now where I can commit to a relationship. And so we tried long distance for or we did long distance for about a year. But I think I started to also reflect and realize that like I didn't have the time that I probably needed to just truly be by myself in between. And so lots of little things happened there as well. And then we ended up breaking up this past July. But we're kind of seeing each other for about two years. And yeah. Especially with med school, like dealing with those emotions from the first relationship and then also trying to balance med school and that like I know like so many of my friends in med school. It's just like they just like it's pretty much like decided that they're going to date other people in med school. So like they're like because otherwise it's hard to like get together like a yeah just be with someone who can understand like how intense something that like that. So now that makes a lot of sense. But yeah, spending another year still trying. Yeah. Yeah, it was complicated. It definitely was your doctor too. He was not. No, he was also a software engineer. And so it was interesting because I think when we met, I was like working kind of just in between undergrad and med school. And then I got into med school. So like a few months in. And so I was very stress free when we met and it was very different than when I started school. Then like yeah. My whole life changed. And so the way that I kind of. Outwardly presented myself also changed just because my stress was so much higher and my time was so much more limited. And so I think that's the nature of our relationship changed because of that as well. So do you feel like that one something you're also still processing? Like how is like how, like what's the healing process been like for that? And how do you feel like I guess like that's overlap with your first relationship? Yeah, definitely. Definitely still processing that one and that one's still a lot. I mean that one's a lot fresher. I mean, it's, I don't want to just I think I don't want to discount that that second relationship had a huge impact on me as well. And like just because it kind of started at a point in my life where I was still processing this past relationship. It wasn't like a, you know, it started it kind of as a casual like maybe reboundy situation or whatever, but it did end up becoming something pretty serious for a while. There's definitely a lot of like yeah processing that and then still kind of processing that I did did that right after the relationship before and how that might affect my previous partner. And so it's it's very convoluted. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can imagine like you wouldn't have tried for like a whole year long distance unless like you were actually like like had some serious attachment. Yeah. So yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Do you, do you feel like you, do you ever think like, oh, I should have done something differently. I should have done this. I should have done that. I have had those thoughts, but I think what I've come to realize is that thinking about the past in that way doesn't necessarily serve me. I think like in the initial stages, it can in terms of reflecting and trying to find some takeaways of how to do things differently moving forward. But I've tried to let that go a little bit now that I'm more removed from both of those breakups because I think it doesn't end up actually resulting in any positive change. And I kind of just feel shitty. So a more trying to reframe is like, okay, well, this is what happened and how do I move forward with it or do things differently next time or kind of manage these friendships that I now have with these people in a way that is okay with me and okay for them as well. Yeah, that's that's fair. And where where where are you at now? I'm at a place now where where I mean, I still get I still miss those people I miss them both like I think they both were very different and our relationships were very different. I think that I've kind of found a comfortable friendship with more so right now with my first partner from undergrad. And I think the second one is still a lot fresher so still kind of figuring out how to navigate that space and like I'm the kind of person that I will do like no contact for a couple of months. It's hard because in my brain I'm like, well, we were really close for a really long time. And so now that we're a little bit further out, like maybe I don't want this person to be completely gone for my life just because we didn't work out romantically. Yeah, which I think can be a crutch sometimes and maybe it's just a way for me to keep these people around in my life without fully processing that we're not in a relationship anymore. I think it's very centering in terms of not feeling like they're these people in my life or not feeling like there was this big loss just because one aspect of how I interacted with somebody didn't end up working out. Yeah, otherwise it starts feeling like there's some kind of ghost. Yeah, you just like did that even happen? Yeah. Yeah, that's the real yeah. We're just like feels like a whole different life and like, yeah. So I guess that's where I'm at now is kind of like, how do I manage trying to manage like friendships with these with both of them and have boundaries, but also like be friends in a normal way and also not worry about how my feelings might be like not feel guilty about the fact that I'm still friends with both of them or whatever. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. You mentioned the idea that like you need to kind of like get to that point where you can separate like the romantic part of the relationship from like the friendship. And you specifically like mentioned how otherwise like there's this feeling of like a ghost in your life, like I'm just curious like what exactly do you mean by that? Yeah, by a ghost. Yeah. I mean, I think as doing as part of processing the whole thing, I think in especially in the initial stages, I think when you're struggling with acceptance, like you the acceptance of the current situation right and the current situation is you have love for this person that person probably has love for you. You're not together. Right. Accepting all those three things and like marrying them is really hard. What I ended up doing and I'll explain why, but what I ended up doing for some time was like just trying whenever I was thinking about it over thinking just shut it down be like no, that person doesn't even exist. That person is like you're just imagining things that whole relationship didn't even happen. Just as a coping mechanism to get out of that storm that I was right denial, just did not just denial and like I don't think it's a good thing. I don't think I don't think it's necessarily very helpful. I think it's like it's like a slight pause from being in that storm, which I guess has its own purpose. But eventually you do have to marry those things. But while while you're kind of convincing years, sometimes you have to convince yourself that. No, I'm not going to say, but I did. I'm not going to say you have to actually, yeah, I don't think you have to, but I did. I ended up just telling myself, just trying to beat that into me like that person didn't exist because it was just so painful to accept the current reality. And so that kind of, and then comes a certain point where you're like you're living your life. And if you start, if you start like finding all the pieces and like finding yourself getting involved in your own life, it's like your previous life feels like a, it feels like a past lifetime. It feels like, and especially if you have no contact, you don't see that person anywhere. No person is only in your memories, right? You don't see them anywhere else. But you do. You do because you see them like, I don't know, you see them while you're doing things. You're visiting something that you visited before. You're going to watch a movie. I'm driving and I look over to the passenger seat and like you see that person, but they're not there, right? That's, that's what I mean by ghost. Got you. Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense to me. It's almost like how a lot of times like when people, I mean, I'll break up is something traumatic. And then when people go through trauma, it's like they want to like kind of deny that it even happened because it's like it's so painful to engage with that it's like they, the only way they feel like they can move forward is kind of to pretend like it didn't happen. But it's like, yeah, like you're saying like that thing is just going to keep haunting you right until you finally get to a place where you think you can process it. So I guess then to move on from that now, yeah, they know like how have you been, how things been for you so far, like after the breakup, have you been holding up? Yeah. I don't know. I feel like I'm figuring it out. I feel like a lot of the big, I keep saying this word, but storm, I would say like the big storm that was there just like above my head has like kind of passed, you know, like it's, it's not, I'm not in that storm anymore. Where it's just like, it's you're just every second of the day you're thinking about it and you really need distractions from it. Yeah, you know, it's like the first thing on my mind, it was the first thing on my mind waking up last thing going to sleep just like constantly there. But now I feel like I'm able to kind of divert the energy more into like just staying present really. And just like divert the energy into like working on different things like about like working on myself working on things like my hobbies stuff like that. And just just into my own happiness really. So yeah, I think that's where I'm still figuring it out. It's still, you know, wavy like it is, but yeah, that's where I'm at. Nice. I'm glad to hear that. I have to hear at least the worst of the storm has passed. I'd say so. Yeah. So I guess what, what do you feel like that healing process look like for you like getting to this point, do you feel like it's primarily time? Do you feel like there were certain things things that you had to think through? Yeah. Yeah, I'd say. Yeah, there were, there were a lot of things that had to think through. But also just time. I feel like in the beginning, like, it was just like a lot of suffering in the beginning, a lot of like. And then I don't know. And then for a long time, I just felt like I was in a days. Like it was just not real. I was just not conscious completely, you know, not able to be present. I was just lost in my head all the time. And just kind of doing things because they made sense to set it up for myself, like even like things like moving to New York. Like I feel like I did that, but I wasn't really conscious of what I'm doing. That all hit like a couple months ago, like a few months ago, I was like, oh shit, I'm actually here. So it was a lot of that. I think in the beginning, there was a sense of like. I don't know, it was it's weird. Like I wanted. I felt like my heart was like wailing, you know, it was like, yeah, it was like just like. I like, I wanted her to come save me, you know, like sitting there like an angry baby, like no, she has to come save me. I had to try to get the top of your lungs. Yes, exactly. But no, it was just like realizing that no, I had I had to save myself this time. Like I had to like, I had to do that. Just like talking, just like understanding. My heart, understanding my brain. I think a lot like working through that and like, you know, anything I needed to think about. How, how the relationship ended where I'm at, like all that stuff. I kind of mentioned this before, but yeah, I feel like I had as people do, but I don't know. Maybe it was just more for me to some extent. Like I'd relied on that relationship a lot for that stability, for the belonging, for the sense of purpose. So I tell like break all that down. Like I had to be like, okay, like I'm going to work on these things individually and like tackle them. And that's kind of the analytical side of it. But on the other side, just developing relationship with yourself so that you can fill in those holes with yourself as they say as cheesy as it sounds. It's true. It's fucking true. So it's just like that. Yeah. So there's that. And then so there was big storm figuring all that out. Then. Then I don't know like it was kind of like, and it's still to some extent. It's like melancholy, you know, like it's not all inside you, but maybe you're able to understand your emotions. So you're projecting it onto the world. But it's like, yeah, it was just like, it felt maybe maybe because it's the winter. I don't know, but it felt like it was the sadness was just in just everywhere surrounding me. It was just in the air in the ether. There's a lot to say, man, I don't know. I don't know how to. In the beginning, I just let go of everything. I was just like. I just let go. I just learned. I just learned how to exist. Because I feel I did it before. And I don't think that's a breakup thing. I just think that's something that I had to work on. And maybe it is a breakup thing. I don't know, but I just stopped caring about everything. Because before I cared about everything. Like everything had to be a certain way. And I stopped caring. I stopped. I just had to learn how to listen to myself. Instead of getting, you know, being pulled in every direction possible by my anxious brain. Yeah. And so yeah, I was just, I was living like a slob for months, like sleeping at 5 a.m. Waking up at 12, just not making my bed, just like. But I needed that. Huh? You calling me a slob? Yeah, I was like, I was living like a here, guys. That's what happened. Tell you that we were lives in the dark place. Yeah. No. But, but no, I, I mean, now I feel like. And then at a certain point, I realized I needed to add some structure or not needed. I wanted to add some structure to help me to help then help me do the things that I wanted to do. Yeah. Because I, if I didn't do the first part, it would just been a repeat of everything that I was doing before. Yeah. And so I added structure to do lists. Literally, I have a to do list right next to me every night. I just write things on the board. Yeah. Tomorrow, I'm going to make breakfast every day of fucking right breakfast. It's so stupid, but I write it anyways. I'm going to eat breakfast. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to, you know, go try this food. I'm going to go meet this friend. I'm going to record this podcast. Just stuff like that. Reminders. So I'm like slowly adding more structure in my life in a way that works for me because before it wasn't like that. So it, yeah. So again, like I'm figuring it out, it's starting, but it's starting to feel like a project again. I'm wanting to, like for the longest time, I didn't want to even engage in my life. Like I just didn't want to be a part of it. And now I'm like starting to engage in it. So that's, that's, yeah, that's where I'm at. Nice. Good to hear. Do you, so when you say you're starting to view your life as a project again, like, I'm just curious. Like do you, do you say that in a good way? Because I feel like, I don't know, like, I don't, I don't know if you mentioned whether you mentioned this when you were talking, but we sort of talked, I guess, like, off the record. Just about like for both of us, I think, like sometimes you get a little too, like, like you said, right, like trying to control everything in a sense. Like trying to have everything planned out instructor. Like do you feel like now you're kind of getting to a healthy place where like maybe you are like planning out your life, but it's not as like obsessive necessarily now. It was like unhealthy. Yeah, it's not, it's doing it in a way that's not obsessive. It's flexible. I mean, I, I realized I needed to have some goals. Yeah, because like I just, it just didn't make sense. Like, what is the purpose of my life? Like all this shit. I spent a lot of time just, I don't know here, like you, you would get messages from me at 4 AM. I'm just like questioning everything. Yeah. And yeah, I, I, I went through a lot like I read, I read, I read some philosophy of, I was at my nihilistic, nihilistic peak. And eventually like, I realized that the point was to just live it because you couldn't, you couldn't assign some all powerful like there, because there's nothing. What's the word I'm looking for? There's no absolute truth, right? It's like, you can say, okay, the purpose of my life is X, Y and Z. But like, it's like, you can poke holes in all of those things, right? You can either say, oh, the purpose of my life is to make the world better. Which is, I guess the noblest way to go about it, but there's something missing. Or you could say like, oh, the purpose of my life is to provide for the people around me, and to, you know, love the people around me. But then it's like, okay, but what about why do you have to live for yourself then? And so it's, I don't know. The only answer that kind of made sense to me so far is just, you have to live it. Yeah, you have to live for life's sake. Yeah, I don't know. Oh man. The, obviously we're getting closer to philosophy. Some of the brains going to be like, thousand different things to, for me to talk about. I see what you're saying. Yeah, like, I feel like when you have something like a relationship that's so central to like your life and your like sense of self, like, yeah, like figuring out how to keep going after that. I can, I guess I have a sense of like where that purposelessness comes from. And I think it's almost like something you said about, you're not sure if it's even like a breakup thing. Like, I think it is, like, I think it is sort of like a very like, it's like a kind of like a guess or no thing where I think it's about like loss in general, where it's like when you go through loss, like part of it is just like the pain and accepting the pain of the loss. And like another part of it is figuring out how to move forward. Now that you're missing that thing that you lost. So, yeah, like that, I feel like that's the more like analytical side of it. And so it makes sense. Like you're sort of trying to like reorient, I guess, like your life. Now that you don't have that in figuring out like, okay, like, how do I direct myself now? Like, where am I going now? This thing that was so core to like my idea of the future. Like, no, that it's gone. Yeah, I mean, let me know if that's like all bullshit since you're the one going through. That makes perfect sense. I saw this thing recently about like this guy talking about how everyone needs a story. Like you need a story. What is your story? You have to be the main character of your story. Otherwise, an absence of that, you're just floating. Yeah. Yeah, that's actually, if you feel like you don't, if you feel like your story ended and it's just like pain afterwards. It's not in a, how do you, yeah. Like, if you see your story is like, all believe, like it's going to be all believe, right? Garat that. No, I mean, I think a lot of what you say resonated with me. I also think that we probably, I think we handled it all in very different ways. It sounds like. Which like at the core, I think the root cause, obviously, and like emotions are similar, but I think our approaches differed a lot. And it's interesting to hear. Kind of how did you get to that same goal and like what path did you kind of end up following? But yeah, I totally agree with that. I've come to appreciate the aspect of life that is just like doing it and. Like living it and not always, I think something that's helped is not always trying to. Make there be a point or like know what's going to happen or like predict how things are going to play out. Because there's always disappointment, I think. And so. Not to say like there's like I don't have goals and expectations, because I do. But I also have like become more willing to just let things play out and realize that or like try to adopt everything happens for a reason. You will get through it kind of mindset. I must feel like the situation kind of forces you to become more okay with just like letting things happen because it's kind of like you can't do anything about the breakup, right? You kind of have to accept that like you don't have any control there because otherwise you're just you're never going to be able to move on. Yeah, did you feel any existential dread me? Well, I think I did and I part of it was like big world things and then part of it was also like the classic am I just going to be alone forever then like is this it for me? And like a lot of I think a lot of it was kind of there like that was the level I was living at. But I think it also I think it probably comes from the nature of our breakups too and like what caused them and stuff. How do you feel like it was different for you? I think well for one, both of my relationships, I kind of initiated the breakup and so I think it's just a whole different perspective from the jump in some ways of like that I was thinking about it for a while and it took me a while from when I kind of started to think that that might be the like next step or like might be what I needed. There was definitely time between that and then like really thinking about it and coming to terms with it and then executing because I think that you don't really execute on those things unless you really sat with it and thought about it and come to terms with it at least for me personally because it's all like the second guessing and really kind of playing out every possible scenario and trying to make sure that like this is truly what is best and I'm not then going to look back and be like well I like messed through something up away that was actually. It was actually good for me and so the timeline of processing I think for me probably started a little bit earlier and like while I was still with this person or these people I guess and so lots of I think part of it is like lots of guilt and cognitive dissonance too and just like kind of like feeling like a really shit person for having these thoughts at all while I was like with somebody and so I felt a lot of. In that way I think maybe it was different and then the kind of emotional processing that goes along with those feelings were probably a little bit different and then also I think coping mechanisms were sounds like we're a little bit different. Yeah. I like push things away and compartmentalized a lot and from the jump really kind of almost just like just try not to think about it and didn't even let myself get into like a. Like too much obviously there was a little bit of it but like the kind of rabbit hole of just like depression rabbit hole situation like obviously I was did and do like struggle with mental health things and like it's not that that wasn't there but I think I did my best to address it by just like ignoring it and distracting myself and filling my time with other things so I didn't have to think about it. And so yeah I think those are probably the two big ways where it sounds like things were different. I've always been jealous of people who can compartmentalize I feel like I can't and it's like god damn it I feel like life would be so much better if I could. I don't know it's kind of it's also just like sometimes makes me feel like a brick wall I'm like oh I don't fucking feel anything and like what is wrong with me that this isn't devastating me in the way that it does for other people. And it's not that it isn't but you just don't think about it and so it like affects you I think it affected me more kind of subconsciously and then I would see like in little interactions I would kind of see how the ends of my relationships affected the way that I carried myself or my thought process or what I perceived is going on around me. And so and then it was much later that I started like cognitively processing those effects and like letting myself. I feel sad and sit with those feelings because I think if I had if I hadn't compartmentalized and if I had just kind of leaned into it from the get go it would have just been so devastating and I don't know if I would have been able to handle those things at that time. That's that's so fair though this is not fun. Like yeah. I don't know I think also like. Both of my like the ends of both my relationships kind of had a trigger point or like a big thing that kind of push over the edge and both kind of came in the form of like something that made me lose trust in that person or like something that was really hurtful that I just couldn't move past like it was a deal breaker for me. And so I also really I think ended up feeling it affected my like sense of self worth a lot that this happened twice back to back and then. Really trying I think something I battle with was really trying to not let that. Trying not to feel like that was a reflection of me and it was something that I did or something that I deserved or whatever. And so processing also like the hurt in the way or like grief but more with the aspect of like oh this person made these choices and was willing to do those things that then like cross that line for me and that they knew would have crossed that line for me. And so kind of grieving that of like oh this person isn't necessarily who I thought and because of this choice they made the future that I had imagined is now going to like is now down the drain. And so it was grief of loss and also just like. Like yeah the sadness around that feeling of like betrayal I guess I don't know. And then I have to be the I felt that I had to be like the quote unquote bad person that then like ends this relationship you know. That's a lot of that's a lot of those two things like feeling betrayed and also feeling like the bad person is like those two are like asked on there by themselves together they like what the fuck it's a shit storm. Yeah. Not literally. How do you how have you kind of dealt with feelings of you know self doubts of self worth is that do you feel like that's better now. I think every day is different in every situations different and I think some days I'm like it feels like I'm very healed and moved past it and have kind of. Actually come term come to terms with the fact that that's not true and then other days I wake up and it feels like. Oh I need to remind myself of that and fake it and so I yeah I wouldn't say I've healed from it I think that it just every days different in some days I feel it. And it really impacts me and it's some days I'm able to not think about it I think it's very like other mental health stuff or other waxing and meaning things. Yeah you have to keep reminding yourself like I mean I feel like that's part of the healing process itself is just developing that muscle of like you know positive thinking and catching yourself right because. I don't know if you healing I mean the way we use the word healing kind of refers to our brains just working perfectly by itself without oversight which is not really you know that's not a fair thing to expect you're going to have to be there. You're going to have to be there you're like the. No that's true like what you were saying about like how we treat the mind when it's almost like we just assume by default like it's going to work perfectly but like I mean we don't. I know it's interesting like we don't think about that way with our bodies like the amount of like yeah yeah it. It needs that consistent effort to like take care of ourselves right to like exercise so I guess like now that you've had some distance from like the actual break up itself like. What do you feel like the most prominent feelings you had during it were I mean we've touched on like grief and grief loss feelings guilt stuff like that but I'm just curious like was there any like were there any feelings you didn't expect. And also like I guess were there any like positive feelings afterwards. I think I expected to feel more anger than I did and also I say that because I think when I was talking to my friends around both of these break ups they would get really angry and then they'd be like why are you not angry or why are you okay with still talking to this person or like why did it even like last as long as it did or whatever all of these things like they're very. They were very fired up and I think it may be it's just like the numbness of like not wanting to think about it and then not so I didn't have to process it. But everything was kind of just a shoulder shrug for me like yeah well I don't know it happened and moved on and figured out what I needed to do and like it sucked but whatever. And I don't know if that was like apathy because depression or actual just me not feeling angry but I think that was something that I wouldn't have thought would have been my reaction. Were you did you kind of feel okay with that in the moment or was it something that almost like made you uncomfortable. I sometimes wish that I was I would get more upset about it or that I had like said certain things or really like. Been more clear about how shitty certain things were and but also I think that was just exhausting yeah and it was like another way for like this person to affect my like mental state yeah. And so I kind of just it was easier just to not and so I didn't and it didn't really bother me. That's fair also I mean. I don't know if there's a fair you guys can correct me but I feel like my friends are more protective of I love me than I am with myself. So like and yeah so I feel like that's generally true yeah and so it makes sense that they would get more mad I know maybe maybe maybe maybe more protective of yourself like that's where probably drawing boundaries comes in you know maybe not as protective as our friends because then you just be angry. But like you know maybe a little bit more yeah yeah maybe standing up for ourselves yeah yeah just to once again probably mindful self compassion workbook that that's something they talk about a lot for being for like developing self compassion is just like that idea of treating yourself how you would treat a friend or how your friends would treat you like we don't treat ourselves with like the same grace and like the same like understanding. That we give to our friends a lot of times. How are you there? I don't know I didn't I don't think I expected I didn't expect a whole lot going into it because I didn't think I was just in it suddenly. And so I mean the whole process has been very much unexpected but yeah like very much needed that's been the feeling throughout it was never really like oh god yeah like why me why like this shouldn't be I mean yes initially yes but like in general like not like oh this shouldn't have happened I you know I needed this like there was always the sense of like I needed that I had thought about before like maybe. I do it sometime right yeah and I realized what that relationship was giving me and I think I was just able to address things more clearly I didn't feelings I didn't expect like I didn't expect to realize that I had such a I know we realized I had such a negative you know self like inner voice and so that was surprising that like oh I do not have things I need to I need to change the way that I you know interact with myself we talk about all this stuff in the past tense but like it's not it's not past tense really like I mean it's a continuous thing like I don't know like there are still things I'm unpacking you know like it's not like I figured it all out like there's still things I'm unpacking yeah. Talk about or do you think you need some more time before you're ready about what I'm attacking like unpacking um I feel like most of it is just like I kind of talked about this before just like understanding the nature of relationships and just like love and that kind of stuff like I don't know it maybe I was taking dating too seriously um But I don't I mean I grew up on Bollywood movies okay I grew up with this idea of love that it was enough like you just you needed love and like it was some kind of magic key that you know if you had it you will figure everything else out like you have to there's no other option um and I mean I guess I'm realizing that it's not that it's not like I don't I don't know what it is it is powerful still but it's not that like it's not like that it's not above everything it's not it's like it's it's powerful yes but it's also fluid it's fickle it's fleeting it's like it's like when you're and then when it's gone you're wondering if it was even there in the first place um and you and then you realize that no it was real and but maybe it served its purpose and maybe like you don't you're not supposed to put that kind of pressure on it because because maybe once it's time for it to leave if you don't let it go it just it cracks from all that pressure instead of just retreating gracefully may and man I don't even know if that's possible but yeah so that so I guess like yeah what I'm trying to say is that all of you should break up with your partners because it's not going to work out okay I guess no I'm kidding but like I don't know I'm just understanding trying to understand the nature of it and like things are helping me like I'm reading some books like just trying to feel it out like I saw Lola Lola I saw Lola Land for the first time oh Jesus Christ that movie is like I feel like it's I liked it I mean it if I I felt like it made me understand what I was going through like it made me kind of get unstuck yeah that movie arrival I don't know like eternal sunshine of this spotless mine just reading books like white nights by Dostoevsky like yeah men without women like there's so many I don't know just feeling it out I'm still understanding do you I don't know does anyone really ever just like oh I I understand how this works like I don't know is that possible do you feel like I hear the master relationships like you figured it out clearly I wouldn't really say that man I mean I honestly feel like everything you're saying about love like even though I have it like broken up with my girlfriend like that is something that like we've definitely gone through where we've had those areas where we realize like there are periods where we like we go through like rougher times and it's like love isn't like this this beautiful like like perfect thing right like love it takes a lot of hard work love takes a lot of effort love can be like very fleeting there even times where I feel like like we tell each other that like oh I know I love you but that's not what I'm necessarily feeling right now like when we have like bad arguments are like when we have tough times so I definitely like like agree with what like the sort of realizations you've been coming to and yeah I definitely don't think there's ever a point like I'm sure I think a lot of people do tell themselves like oh I understand love oh I understand loss like I understand all of these things but there's always like new levels right there's always new things to understand and explore and like new perspectives to gain and it's like it's kind of like the process of like every time you come into it with your understanding and you're kind of like oh like I kind of like know what to do like I've learned from last time but then you get knocked back down again and something new comes up and that's just the process right they'll never be an end. Yeah but I guess you need those periods of like oh yes I have figured it out it's nice oh yeah definitely like because without it then what's the point if you're always just questioning everything. Yeah yeah I mean you have to have like confidence in where you are at the same time as like being able to realize and problems come up right how about you or is there anything you feel like you're still trying to unpack. I mean I think like it's hard to say specifically I think a lot of it is like little things day by day like I don't know I will be in a new situation and then it reminds me of something and then I realize that oh there's this way to look at this whole situation or there was this other thing that I didn't consider or oh this is still affecting me. And so I think it's like I'm constantly like unraveling more things and I think that especially when it comes to kind of dating post break up too I think that's a huge port like I think that triggers a lot of unpacking that I just like haven't done yet and so yeah I don't I think I'm still it's all all the work in progress. Yeah. Sorry. Have you been dating since your last relationship? Have you been going on dates? I've been on a few like here and there. I'm not I mean I don't have like much time to be honest but I also don't really I think I'm not really dating to find anything serious it's more just like for the experience of it and so I'm not super frequently but like everyone's in a way. I think I think there's a good level of it right now and like my expectations are like I don't have expectations I'm not like looking for anything but it's just like I think there's just joy and meeting people and talking to people. Yeah. And so kind of like that is that the way in which I'm dating right now but it's been good. Here we take. Nice. Yeah. I think it's yeah go ahead. I was just I was saying that I think it's like good in the sense to be able to reframe it in that way and like I think immediately after relationships I was dating to kind of fill that whole of like I was constantly talking to somebody or like had somebody to share things with and now I don't and so initially when I was dating after relationships it was like trying to like fill that time or find that the next. Yeah. Whatever like whoever was going to fill that role for me. And so I think since it's I think that because it's been two breakups and now I've had time I've kind of really been able to approach it more of like I'm just doing this for myself to like have a good evening and then if it goes somewhere and if it doesn't it doesn't then fine. And that's been newer and it's but I think it's been a healthy way to be able to go on dates and do those things without feeling guilty or then like overthinking or getting back into this like grab a whole of processing my old breakups. I think that's pretty healthy. Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. I mean it sounds healthier than most alternatives. Yeah. What about you Devon? I mean I have gone on dates. Like I did date in the beginning when I moved to New York. But in the beginning it was very much just like insecurity based. Just like I had to get out there and just prove to myself that I could do it first. And once I did that. You know got the experience figured out how it works like just I don't know I mean I just had a look on the first time I just had a learning anxiety like going and meeting. Talking to someone that I'd never talked to before. So just like overcoming that realizing that oh okay I'm actually pretty good at conversation. This is fine. Going through that process realizing that okay I see what this is. It's fine. It's like it's not that great. It's not it's not all the hype I guess. It's okay people are like yes it's nice to meet people but also people are just people like if you can meet people in other ways like. You can do that too but like it doesn't have to be dates. So so I did that and now I'm just at this point where like I went a lot of dates like in this very short span of time. And now I'm just like I don't want to I just I want to like I don't I know that I'm not looking for anything. I don't have space for someone in my life right now. I just can't I would be a terrible boyfriend if I was to date someone right now. So I'm not I just realized I just started to value my own time and my own energy and put that towards things that I actually want to do. Then might give me more happiness and invest in those things. So like I've joined sports leagues like I'm playing volleyball and kick pickleball and spending certain days like you know working on the podcast. And then sometime just to myself doing something else creative like just hanging out with friends. I've been investing a lot in new friendships. That's been that's been very fulfilling. So yeah that's I don't know I don't want to you were you were mentioning this like are you're saying like Oh the feeling of oh I'm always going to be alone like maybe this is it. I'm trying to I don't know I'm kind of comfortable now with the idea of just being I mean I know it sounds stupid but like just being the fun uncle like is that so bad like I don't know it sounds pretty great. Like yes yes you can call me fucking like naive and oh yeah this guy just went through art break but like it doesn't sound too bad right now. I don't know if I could do if I want to do all this again. I know I probably will at some point but yeah. No that's fair. I think it's like super important. And what I'm also realizing is like the time by yourself is very important or like I'm now realizing the value of that. And like there are people who that's just what they want in life and so no harm in being the fun uncle I think. Yeah I think that's honestly a very healthy perspective like to be like just comfortable where it's like if life takes you to a point like you'll just be happy on your own right that you're comfortable enough with yourself that you don't feel like you necessarily need someone. Yeah. I mean it's nice right it's like it's literally the worst case scenario. Yeah. And if you're not afraid of the worst case scenario. Yeah. It's fine you won't have that like constant anxiety of like I'm gonna end up alone. Because this shit is like it feels like a lottery like you know you just keep. And it's like investing in Bitcoin. Yeah. It's a pyramid scheme. Yeah. I got you. I hear do you ever feel like do you ever feel like you wish you you know got this whole casual like day casual dating experience. You're wake up and you're like you man I wish I wish I was in a relationship in a situation ship. I wonder what that feels like. I wonder how much I can say no actually me and I should have a very comfortable with this we both talked about it with each other too but yeah I mean it's definitely something we were both talked about where it's like even in college right like we start dating like what one month into college so it's like and we've never like been intimate with anyone else like we never like. I don't know if I'm going to be around or anything so it's like there is that part of me that wonders like oh like how who would I be like if I didn't have her in my life you know if I just like had to kind of like develop on my own and like how would those experiences like change my life you know like meeting new people just being more casual in my like yeah in my relationships. But I think it's like. I think it's like I think I'm in like in a I'm trying to find a good way to give me what you're trying to say is literally never been put into words so. A few moments later. It's like I guess that I kind of know that like it's sort of like a life path that I guess hopefully I'll never have and it's kind of like I feel at this point like I'm comfortable either way if we stay together for the rest of my life like I know I know that that's what I want and I know that I'm not like if I wait as to it's not worth it for me to like yeah like it's not something I guess that that is that important to me compared to my relationship but at the same time. Like I do think that like and obviously like this is still struggle like some days or rather than others but at the same time like I do think there's a part of me that like I want to be comfortable with the idea that like I like my life could go on like even if something happened to a relationship and then it's like. Like I'm not going to just dwell on that for the rest of my life you know like that's an opportunity to explore these new experiences that I've never had in the past you know so it's sort of like to like summarize my thoughts it's kind of like i'm trying to I kind of try to see both sides where I do think like there are things that I missed out but at the same time. Like being able to see the value in those new experiences that I'll hopefully never have well at the same time like being happy with where I am right now and understanding like that's like a choice that I'm making and one that I'm happy with. Yeah that's a good way to put it. But that's the thing that path you were mentioning yeah that's why like I don't know that's why it's so important for for it was I mean for me at least it was so important that I have this single time because I because like that thought of like oh if this didn't work out if I was in a relationship and it didn't work out like that was terrifying like. Because that I mean people get divorced at you know 20 years after marriage and it's like it's like at that point like if you never had that sense of self or like if you never felt comfortable with the idea that like yes you at the end of the day you are by yourself. Then that would be terrifying that would be like insanely difficult. Oh so that's why I'm very glad that I have this right now I'm developing that. Yeah I got you. Yeah I feel like good. Yeah I feel like even for me like that's only something like I feel like I went through that same struggle just like in my relationship where it's like for me and I got for graduation like I think like even now that we've moved in together like a lot of like the trouble that comes up and a lot of like a conflict comes out of that sense of trying to develop that where it's like we're both trying to have individual lives and individual like senses of self where we feel like secure in ourselves. As individuals we're still balancing that with like our relationship and allowing that to like evolve like as we evolve as people and like obviously like trying to keep that together while still like being true to ourselves. Yeah what I was thinking about when you were saying that so my first relationship also started like very early in college and then was the entirety of college and so a lot of that time that I think like colleges classically branded as one of those times where you like get to know yourself and find you know who you are. And so that whole part of development and like of my life was done like with somebody like attached at the hip to somebody else right and so my initial sense of self was very rooted in this other person as well and so I think that was one of the things that was really difficult about kind of letting go of that relationship was I viewed it as I think there was a finding. Figuring out how to exist in a relationship not because I felt that I had to and that there was no other way to keep my head above water because it was like the only adult reality that I knew versus like realizing that that is not what I want for my future and like want my life to be and I want it to feel like every day that I'm in a relationship it's because I'm choosing to be there as an individual person it's like serving me. And obviously like so much empathy towards the other person and I obviously care about how it's affecting them as well but just being okay with having that more selfish point of view sometimes. Yeah. So that I don't get trapped in that like oh this is the only way I can exist is with this other person so I have to be here. Yeah. You want to want your partner not need them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think like that's a big reason honestly why a lot of people like especially who have been together for a while in college and breaking up because I think like yeah like especially once you're out of like that structured environment and it's like like before that like throughout school and everything you have these clear goals you have this clear structure like something that you need to do. And after that you kind of realize like oh I can kind of do anything now and it's like I feel like to a certain extent I don't even like I don't have like a strong enough sense of who I am to even know what direction to move in. Yeah but I mean so now like I don't know I feel like now it's because you separated okay like be with someone because you want to be with that person instead of needing and it's just I know the idea of that is like. I feel like I'm going to struggle with like because I don't know like if it's like you're not going to want to be with someone all the time. Yeah. Like it's just not possible you're not every day of your life you're not so like what you're just going to every time things get difficult and you don't want to be there you're just leaving maybe that's okay I don't know but that also seems not great I mean I don't know. I feel like there's nuance though like I think that's where like and I hear you mentioned this earlier of like oh even when in that moment you're like arguing with somebody and you're like I don't really like you might not feeling actively like thinking about how much you love this person or like how great this person is in your life when you make like a long I don't know I think that like when you make that kind of long term commitment it's about being able to find that place of knowing. Okay yeah maybe in this moment right now things would be easier if I wasn't here with this person and if I was by myself but also like I've invested all these things and taking a step back like I do really love and care about this person and value them in my life. And so that's why I'm choosing to go through this difficulty and these times where maybe it's not like always the most positive thing because you've built that foundation and I think that like that's how at least for me like that's when you kind of come to realize. If that doesn't exist anymore and you're not able to kind of take that step back and view it through that lens. Or like when I'm if I'm at that point then that's when I kind of know that okay this is where I make that decision of the want right now isn't there and it I can't justify like yeah. The feeling or what I mean. I guess you have to keep asking the question like that's the thing but you have to keep going through that process. No 100% and I'm honestly sure like I think you hit a nail in the head like that was literally the part of what I said that I was going to bring back up. But yeah I think it's about like yeah like in the moment you might not necessarily want someone but at the same time like when we have an argument like you might not feel that but then when you we take that step back when we have that time apart it's about like recognizing like yeah I do still love this person even if it's not necessarily what's what I'm feeling like the most strongly. And I think that's exactly the point because it's like every time after an argument where we come back and we sort of like resolve it that's us consciously choosing to do that every time you know like if the situation was bad enough and we didn't work together like we would choose not to get back together you know we would choose not to resolve it but I feel like you're not like that feeling of like want to be able to do that. I think that feeling of like want to like you can't like the security and the relationship come I feel like comes from that feeling that like every day I'm choosing to be with you and that's something that I want to do and like it's not something where I need to be with you it's not something where it's just like oh we've been together for so long like that's why I'm with you but it's that like that feeling that like oh every day like there's small things that like remind me like why I love her. That make me like feel like yeah I could maybe get new experiences like with new people and like casually dating and stuff like that but I'm choosing not to do that it's not just something that's like falling into my life because my like this this way. Like I strongly believe like love is much more of a process than it is feeling a lot of the time. Yeah I agree with that too I think it's something that you kind of make and work on together and then it's again like about evaluating every day like is this what I want given all of the information or everything that's happened or you know because you can also like still love somebody and then but not be in a relationship or like not be able to continue dating them right so I think it all plays together too. Yeah. I don't know. I had a question. Did you have got to do you have any like big breakthrough moments where you were like I don't know I mean there's been times like where I felt like there are times where it's like oh I see this differently now. Oh maybe it will be okay. Oh this isn't so bad like that kind of stuff that's sudden realization like oh maybe I'm not a terrible person you know like I'm not a terrible person. You know like like that kind like did you have you had those moments. Yeah I definitely have. I think well in terms of the like last thing you said of like oh maybe I'm not a terrible person. If I were to be honest like I think the realizations around things like that have come when I get third party perspective which isn't maybe like the healthiest way to or like the most healed or sent her way to do it or whatever but I definitely lost myself a lot in the process of like breaking up and dating and breaking up and all that stuff and so like as cheesy as it sounds like talking to people who have known me for my whole life and being able to like people that I know I can like truly truly be honest with and not have to like sugar coat things or whatever. And just like hearing somebody else's perspective or like their reflection of me like what they know to be true about myself when I forgot a lot of things. Yeah. I wouldn't say like necessarily in those moments but after sitting with it those conversations for a while and reflecting on them. I would be able to apply. I started being able to apply with what my friends or whoever you know kind of talk to me about. I began kind of taking those thoughts and like yeah being able to apply them to my daily life or kind of just sit with them and I think those things are kind of what pushed me in that direction or like helped me kind of make some of those realizations. But I think the actual like big moments of like feeling shift where when I was doing things by myself that I like never would have done before. Yeah. And for so long I was just so not able to spend time by myself for like things that like I wouldn't do on my own and so when I started doing things on my own and like realizing that I could make whatever choice I wanted and like truly do at whatever without considering anybody else. Those were some of those moments where I was like yeah this is like it's going to be okay and this is so cool and I literally never would have done it. If this shitty breakup didn't happen so. I'm glad you brought that up that's like oh man the doing things with yourself like. Yeah I remember the first time I went to watch a movie by myself. That was nice that was like oh I can do this just eating by myself was I mean I'm sure was did you sell it how you sell the travel before your breakup or was that after. Oh um after the so I did like trips with friends beforehand but yeah by myself was after yeah that must have been big. Yeah huge part of it is like you're by yourself so you have to do things on your own yeah like and I think that helps of like. Well I don't have any other choice really so I'm just going to do these things and it like one of the big trips. I just like bought my flights in and out and like booked my stay for the first city and then I was like okay well I don't have anything else planned and I'm just going to figure it out as I go and then make it to my final stop and then fly back home. And it was so cool to be able to like every day decide like what do I want right now like what do I want to where do I want to go or what do I want to do. And like truly not work like think about making sure somebody else was okay or like incorporating with somebody else wanted and so yeah that was huge. It's so much easier to plan for two people. The moment the moment it goes like one person you're like oh you're planning for yourself it's like I'll just stay home whatever. So yeah that was big I mean yeah even my solo trip I feel like both of them I think the second one more so like I just went to Costa Rica a couple months ago and that was like yeah I was fully able to just be present there and realize that like hey like my happiness is worth something even if it's just me. And just kind of yeah like you said just answer that question every day like what do I want to do today. Just learning how to accept tap I think for the longest time I just didn't want to accept happiness at all. I don't think I ate dessert for like four months. I just couldn't like I just wasn't worth it. Yeah but just learning to accept happiness again and then giving it to yourself repeatedly was that was huge. And I think I think solo travel just the move to New York solo travel just to help me kind of get through that process a little bit. Yeah that's interesting. I don't I can't say that I don't think that that was the case for me which so it's like interesting to hear about. I definitely like though and the type to listen to sad music and make myself sadder and like do those things and be like oh I don't deserve happy right now. And so I did that to a little bit of an extent for sure. But it's yeah it's interesting to hear kind of what that looked like for you. I still listen to sad music. Let's get the Arctic. It's so nice. Yeah I also think moving cross country like moving especially because New York is like there's always shit to do so you just step out of your apartment and like yeah it's it's helpful. It's really helpful because you don't have the like barrier to entry is pretty low for anything right and so that was definitely super helpful for me too. It's just like getting there and my whole like day to day it's so different from if you're still in the place where like you had. Yeah your break up was or whatever around those people and then that's kind of like think about. I needed more single friends and I found them here all my friends are in relationships make can you believe it like literally like 95% of my friends in home are like happy relationship. What the fuck. Oh yeah. Sneezes. I've heard so many. No I just know so many single people from the Bay who are just like as soon as they broke up with long term relationships they're like we're going to New York. Oh man. Speaking of sitting on the Bay like I was invited to this party next week and it's on a Thursday and so they sent out a tax blast saying like giving like some instructions and stuff and like one of the instructions was. Yes this party is on a Thursday if you have a problem throwing down on a Thursday please move to San Francisco. I thought that was hilarious. I'm going to send it to all my barrier friends. You fucking losers. That's interesting. I feel like I should like Aasha would go out a lot on Thursday but maybe that's just her. Keep your opinions to yourself. I should stop talking. You're an involvement. Yeah. You're on Seattle. That's true. Fuck us. Monkey laughed is better than every club in San Francisco. Okay. These are just facts for us. I'm not going to argue with you here. Saying she went out of Thursdays does not mean that the night lights mean was better on Thursdays or any day of the day. Today's episode is brought to you by the race her pill. You remember the machine they had in the turtle sunshine of the spotless mine? The one that deletes all your ex's memories? What if I told you they turned that into a real thing? You no longer have to sit there in your musty booty melon collie. You don't have to listen to Hans Zimmer or Urgit Singh or Hozier or Taylor Swift while walking down the street going to the gym. I mean obviously where else are you going to go? You don't have to keep watching those sad reels on the toilet with the pianos in the background? You know the ones I'm talking about? The ones where Anna Derema is just smiling, looking all cute and you're like, yup, that was her for real. I'm just going to kill myself. And the best part is that you don't have to be hooked to some horrible machine overnight in your own house. And wonder if the weird operator is going to invite his girlfriend over and have sex in your house while you're unconscious? No, no, no. This is just a pill. All you have to do is connect your new link to their server and upload your brain map along with your ex's name and picture. Then they will send you a pill and then you take that pill and swallow it specifically with pineapple juice. Yeah, I know you don't keep pineapple juice anymore, but you're just going to have to go get some for it to work. Because it won't work otherwise. But anyways, you take the erase her pill before going to sleep and boom, the next day you will have forgotten her completely. Now you've moved on without doing the work of moving on. Perfect. Focus on that mission, focus on the grind, get that back, get those six pack abs. Then eventually when you start dating someone else, you get to make the same mistakes and ignore the same red flags all over again. They do say life is cyclical, right? I mean, it's meant to be. So go get it. It's worth it. I think it'll be great. Just go to raceforpill.com and use code BluntRotation15 for a 15% discount and now back to the show. I mean, I kind of, I don't know like listening to you guys like describe this stuff. Like, you know, all the things you guys said about, you know, choosing it every day and all that stuff. It makes me, it makes me feel like a kid when it comes to, I don't know, because like, I, I feel like I'm still coming out of this very like, maybe like a more naive interpretation of what relationships are meant to be and what love is meant to be. Um, yeah. I think it's cool. I feel like I'm growing up now. Yeah, I think it is like very much like a fact and for thing to, right? It's not like I necessarily feel that every day right there times where I feel like I need her and I like a really rely on her and depend on her. Yeah. It's a bit like a bit of a public thing romantic and I just feel like like to the moon about like who she is. And like our relationship and stuff. I think it's yeah, like just about being able to like kind of like whether the problems as they come and like keep everything in perspective, you know. Yeah, just continuous like evaluation. say like I think it's ideal. I don't think I'm there. That's where I want to be and I try to be, but it doesn't, yeah. I wouldn't say that's truly how I exist all the time. Yeah, I will say especially for me, I think that I kind of have two sorts of problems where sometimes I feel like you where I feel like, oh I really need her. I really depend on her. Like I can't imagine how would I live with my life without her. She feels that crucial, but I think that other times, for me specifically, I'm very much an individualist and I think sometimes when I'm going through trouble a lot of times, I just go radio silent, and just go on my own because I think even to a toxic level to some extent, I feel this need that I need to be completely self-sufficient. I need to be able to exist without relying on anyone else or needing anyone else with support. So yeah, I mean, it's not like something that's easy. I think, yeah, it is like again, like something that you negotiate every day, trying to find a balance. Yeah. There are certain things you have to do every day. I didn't, yeah, I feel like I've always been in this mode where it's like, yeah, you work on something and then it's done. It's fixed, but it's not like that. Yeah. I like saw this quote the other day. I'm definitely going to butcher it, but it was basically along the lines of like how you live your life every day when you wake up, it's like how you live your life. And so I think it's at least for me, like I'm, I like think about how I like want to live my life or like what, just like these ideas of like what my perfect day, or like all these things would look like and like the mindset that I want to carry. But then I like finished thinking about all that stuff and like don't do it. And so I think the current, it's like a big goal or like something that I'm always working on and have just now realized that I need to work on is like, okay, I can like theorize about all these things, but like I need, if I don't put it into practice every day, then like all the time's going to go by and I'm still just theorizing about these things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely a big thing for me, where it's like I want to think like, oh, I check this thing off. I'm done now. Everything's good. And yeah, it's kind of difficult to realize like no, like you need, like if you don't just continuously put an effort, like it's things are never going to like stay stable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is a thing. I mean, even meditate for like, I don't know, like I'll meditate for two days. And I'm like, no, I'm good. And then the third day, I won't do it. I just won't do it. No matter what, if I'm not feeling shitty, I won't do it. Yeah. Yeah. I feel you. And it's fucking terrible. I need to do it. Like, yeah. Yeah. Oh, man. I'm so bad at taking care of myself. Yeah. It's like the eternal struggle, right? Like you do something. You feel better. And then you're like, oh, I don't need to do this thing anymore. I feel better now. But then it's like you just end up back in the same place. You know, what's the line from like, Bojack? Like, it gets easier every day. It gets a little easier, but you gotta do it every day. That's the hard part. And the thing you said about like, oh, how you live every day is how I mean, that's like something that I've been working on quite a lot. I feel like I was just miserable all the time before. And now I'm realizing, oh, I don't have to be miserable. Everything is fine the way it is. That floppy pizza has value. I don't have to be miserable about it. It doesn't have to be crispy. It doesn't have to be hot. It's okay. It's okay that the pizza is lukewarm and floppy. Oh, man. Which pizza spot hurt you? No, dude. The pizza, yeah. Yeah. The pizza isn't metaphor for everything. Yes. You know, you can just ask the pizza guys to make your pizza extra crispy. No, but then that's like, but that just means you're not satisfied. And like ever, you know, I think this metaphor is going to interesting. No, you have to suffer because I can't ask for my pizza toast a little while. No, what I mean is you don't have to suffer. Like, it's okay. Like not that I'm not saying don't ask because you should stop. No, I kind of get it. I'm saying it has it still has value. Like, it's different. You know, like, they're like, I don't know. Like, it's cool to eat a floppy pizza sometimes. It's like, oh, this is this, that mean certain things. You just you don't, I mean, I feel like we put these things on tears. And it's like, no, this has to be this way. Otherwise, there's no value. Just realizing that, yes, this floppy pizza still, you know, it's still satisfied my hunger. It's still tasted good. Like, yeah, it wasn't perfect, but it took the job. I don't know. No, I, I'm, yeah. I actually know. Yeah. No, I know exactly what you're talking about, like that, like, because I feel like I get in the same house, based on a times, or if something isn't perfect, my brain just goes to like, oh, I need to, like next time, I need to fix this. And I just like, like, just roommate on that, like everything that's wrong when it's like, yeah, floppy pizza, like, maybe that's not perfect compared to what I wanted. But it's still, I can still enjoy it, right? I can still have a good time eating it. And I'm just going to lose out on everything that's valuable about it, like, like, fixating on like, oh, this is like worse than another type of pizza that I could have gotten. Yeah. All you're doing is just ruining that moment. Yeah. I also, I like, similar, but if something is not perfect, or if I don't think I can do something perfectly, then I like won't do it. Yeah. And so also just like, I'm like, oh, I want to be able to like do a whole like perfect morning routine and like get up and don't use my phone and walk outside and make breakfast and wait for 20 minutes and jump. But then if I wake up and I'm like, well, I can't do all that shit. Then I won't do one of the things. Yeah. Well, I could, like, walk outside for five minutes still, even if I can't do the 20 other things I wanted to do. And then that like holds me back. And I just like, don't do stuff because it's like not exactly how I like wanted it to be perfectly. Yeah. Me, me not doing anything during the day because I only did 19 out of 20 things I had on my checklist in the morning. Yeah. That's why I picked one thing. You know, it'll be like one thing that I need to do out of the things out of all of the 500 things that I want to do, you know, I'll do one thing tomorrow. And that's that's enough. That's health, man. You get make to do this, man. Get yourself a void. I will recommend whiteboards to everyone. It's fantastic. Yeah. I essentially do that with my iPad. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever made any big realizations on Schroomsgar or acid? I don't think I've made any big realizations. No, I was boring, but honestly, part of the time, like half of the time, I'm just like anxious. And then I just have to sit there and be like, okay, you will get through it just like close your eyes, let the time pass and then like you'll be fine. And then other times I'm just like giggling and vibing and laughing. Like, how do I ever like got into that existential place yet? I'm always there, man. That's what I was like. Yeah. No, like the last time I did it, I was like, I mean, I felt that whole miserable thing too. But it was like a big moment where I was like, okay, I do, I have to maintain myself here. I have to maintain composure. And like just doing that was like, oh, shit, I just did that. That was crazy. That was cool. That was like valuing itself, I guess. Yeah. I feel like I maybe have things like that and like talk about them in the moment or whatever and have these crazy realizations and conversations. But then as soon as I'm like clear headed, like, none of it like sticks. I just feel like I forget it all. And I think it's also one of those things like, you know, like, you know, in like grade school, and they would bring inspirational speakers. And then they would like give these speeches and you would be like really motivated for like two days and then just like forget it all. I feel like it's like that. Yeah, I definitely have both happened where it's like, yeah, sometimes it like sticks and sometimes it doesn't. I guess like I want to ask about maybe for you, this was before your actual breakup. But like, did you have to like, did you ever have to let go of that feeling of you? How do you deal with the feeling of like, oh, but that was just so special. That was just so nice. It was so good. Whenever it was at whatever point it was during the relationship, maybe it wasn't even that during the end. But at some point it was like, how do you, I don't know, I feel like I started off for a while. I feel like I have come to terms with it a little bit, but I do find myself still struggling a lot, but that was just so good. How do you let that go or have you let that go completely? I mean, that's hard. I like, it's, I definitely always like continued to hold on and probably like still have days where I do hold on to that idea of like that relationship was so unique and it's not something I'm going to be able to find anywhere else. And now it's gone and I can't relive those moments anymore either. And like, oh, yeah, I definitely were like, that, now that's in the past and like, that's it. And it's not, I'm never going to experience that again. I do still have days and moments where I'm like in that headspace for sure. But I think that also, and this is maybe like not again, not the most like the healthiest way to have gone about it, but it was my reality of like, I made a really strong, after my first really big breakup, then I made, I ended up making a really strong connection with somebody else. And like, even right now, like that feels, it feels, it feels so weird to kind of verbalize and like say that out loud, but I think that was when I first kind of internalized the idea of like, maybe there's not just one like soul partner for everybody in this world, because I definitely, I had that hopeless romantic view of everything beforehand. And I think the like truly what pulled me out of that mindset and stopped me from like constantly mourning this like idea that I would never have anything like that again was that I like did hit it off with somebody else and built a really close relationship with somebody else and felt that same feeling of it being so special and so unique. And so, yeah, like I kind of a should you like maybe not the most ideal way to kind of realize those things or whatever, but yeah, being able to like realize that oh, it did happen again, kind of gave me hope and solace that like, yeah, that was unique. And this next experience was also unique in its own way and special in its own way. And so I might not have that exact same experience again, but I'll have new ones that I didn't have with those previous people. I don't think that's like, uh, bad at all. I mean, I think there's a lot of value in what you did. Like, I mean, in a certain sense, like you don't know things until you experience that, right? Like how can you, how can you convince yourself of something if you don't experience it? Um, so that makes sense. I mean, at least like I see it as a positive, at least you are open to the idea of you're open to the idea of entering that relationship with or like even getting that close to someone. I know that I'm going to struggle with the idea of even opening being open to that. Like I'm not even so that's going to prevent me more from feeling that. Um, so, but I think I think that's a good thing. I think that's a great thing. Turning things back to the beginning. Like, like immediately after, like now that you've had some distance, I guess, like, how do you feel like you coped with the big breakup initially? And like, how healthy do you feel like that was in retrospect? Like the sorts of things that you did? I feel like, I don't know. I feel like we should just separate those questions because like, how you how you feel like, I don't know, I don't think there's any point in assigning a grade to what you did, right? Like I think there's value in the kinds of coping mechanism. Yeah. And like every one of them is conservative purpose in a different situation, right? So, yeah. Healthy, like, uh, unhealthy way of thinking about it. Yeah, maybe unhealthy. Yeah, that's fair. I just, yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting. But no, I understand. I was honestly thinking that myself like after I said it, that like, that was not maybe the best way for me. Yeah. That's fair. Yeah. But I mean, for me, like, I mean, I mentioned this, like, this storm initially, but just like getting through that, I think, um, I just had to develop this voice and kind of separate myself from my feelings. Yeah. And so this is something where like, I don't know, I got some concepts that I learned through like, like just learning about like Buddhism a little bit. Yeah. Just like the idea of separating yourself and, you know, realizing like, like telling yourself things like, hey, like, I am the sky. I'm not the clouds, you know, like when you're in that shit storm, like, I am, I'm the ocean, not the waves, just like stuff like that, um, separating yourself from the mo from your emotions. One thing I realized is cool. Um, I heard that like, I mean, you've heard of this hypothesis of like how the language you speak kind of determines the way you think. Yeah. Um, so in English, and this is very true for me, like, in English, like you identify with the emotion. So you say, I am scared, right? That's how you say it. In Spanish, it's like, yo, thing, go, I don't know, I'm bad at Spanish, but the translation is like, I feel fear. It's not that I am scared. I am fear. Like I feel it. And in Tibetan, you say fear has arrived. It was just like completely, you're separating this shit storm that's coming your way from yourself. And, and then you're able to just let it come, just accept it with grace, let it come, understand it, give it the respect that it deserves, the attention that it needs, and then let it go. Whereas like, I would just be two before I would just be so caught up in it. That it was just a pit, like it was just an endless pit. Um, so that helped. What else? Weed. Weed is great. I mean, it just let me just sometimes, it just, it let me organize my thoughts sometimes, but sometimes it just let me just focus on what was around me, you know, just like eating something or just like watching a movie or just like, and that was nice because it took me out of that. Yeah, I don't know, what do you have to say for her? No, that was all helpful and things that I kind of will definitely be thinking about more moving forward. I think, well, like from the get-go it was definitely a combination of like crying and distracting myself from work with work and like just making sure I was busy all the time. And like also, yeah, music and weed and all of those things, those like classic coping strategies. And I think it was very like, um, it fluctuated a lot. Like some, there was times where it was like, yeah, I was just like keeping myself so busy and like distracting myself with things. And then there was times where I was really moping and um, I think what ended up being super helpful. Definitely part of it was just good old therapy was super helpful, plug for therapy. I think, um, just like, yeah, talking to somebody about it all and like, kind of helping, like somebody, like talking to somebody who could help me like reflect on myself. And then also coming to the realization that like, in my really, this is specifically, I first started doing this after my first relationship, but um, realizing that like reflecting on my mental health and kind of evaluating, honestly, like the status of my mental health. And I came to realize that um, there was a lot of codependency towards the end of my relationship from my end just because like, I was in a, like not into the best place mentally. And so, when I wasn't going to therapy, and I didn't have any other coping mechanisms, so kind of having like this person was my source of happiness. And so then when I kind of started like having those realizations after going to therapy, then I kind of started figuring out what I could do about it to help fill some of those holes that made me so sad. And so like finding, yeah, other things to do to be happy and like work on, that was super helpful. And um, like just making new friends and like going to events and just like trying new things that I wouldn't and like going to dinner by myself and going to movies by myself and things, all that stuff. And like truly doing that, finding yourself, portion of college, a little bit, but just like actually by myself this time. Yeah. And so I think that was super helpful. And also just like figuring out like my other like chronic things that I just like hadn't thought about and kind of really taking control back in my life and like figuring out like, I figured out after that point that I have narcolepsy. And so I was like always sleepy all the time in college. And I didn't know why. And I realized like, and I finally took that time to like, and gave it to myself to like figure out what is going on. I was able to like make my everyday so much better. And that was just like the huge step. And then from there it was kind of just I was starting 10 steps ahead after I kind of did all of those things or started all of those like journeys or whatever. And then it was easier to cope and then easier to start processing and then properly after. After you realize you were a narc. Yeah, basically, well just like all this, I was like, I was like, yeah. Oh, like a narcone. I was like, you just went pouring and I was like, I feel bad for nothing now. I don't know what to do. Yeah. What truly though, I just like wasn't sleeping all the time. And that really helped. So, yeah, it's not fixed for everyone, but it's good for me. So what is it? Is it just like, how do you deal with it? Like, what is the solution? It was just like medication. Honestly, I just like don't fall asleep. But it was I think like the takeaway from that or what I was trying to say was like, I actually spent time figuring out myself. And like, all because before all of my free time would go to like hanging out with this other person and I told him to sideline my own needs. And then like when I was able to actually like that that in and of itself kind of got me a few steps into this whole coping thing when I was like, oh, let me give myself this attention and like actually build a stable wife as an individual. And like doing those things and giving myself that time to figure that shit out was like so helpful. That's so fair. There are so many things that were making me miserable all the time. And just like, you know, now I have space to actually figure it out. Like medical, I started physical therapy for my foot that I was I banged up and I just never did it because I never had time and I never wanted to take care of myself. And now I'm doing it. And it's so valuable. Yeah. And just, you know, having the energy to self correct like, you know, all your negative self-talk and your destructive tendencies and yeah, that's just I feel like I feel like such a thing. I think I'm just learning how to live life, which is so stupid. Like I feel like a baby. I'm just, okay, this is how you do things. It's like, what? Like how did we not do this? Yeah. I totally agree. Or like you guys are just like doing this stuff by yourself this whole time. Like you're just, what? And yeah, that's a good feeling when you're like past the heart or like a little away from the like struggle part of doing those things. Yeah. On the other side, it's it's like a feeling. I'll keep my life right now, even though I haven't gone through a breakup. I think how to live like every day life. I've done nothing. Well, also I think part of it is like adulthood and like post-pology, that just like happen to line up with these things for us. But it's a motivator too. I don't know for me when I think about this, but like how do you, what do you think of the future, Garra? If you even think about it, like are you, I don't know, how do you? Yeah. If I asked you like, how do you, how do you feel about your future? What would you say? That's so broad. I would like, I'd say if I to come up with a few words or whatever, I would say I'm scared. I'm excited. I guess scared but also anxious. Yeah, excited. Like looking forward to all the different stages of life. Also just like, but then yeah, also just like worry that I'm not making the right decisions or like that things won't go the way that I want them to go or whatever. But I don't know. I don't think I'd give you the same answer every day though also, but yeah. I'm excited though too. Just to kind of see like where things go and like who I am as an adult, like a real, you know. Yeah. And any advice for people? Any advice? God, no. Yeah, I don't, I'm no authority on advice. Just therapy is the only advice I have and everyone says it but that's what I got. We need a five point plan for moving on. I guess like I did have one more question like a lot in similar lines for you guys. And I don't even know if there's really that much to talk about, but do you guys feel like you're still coping with the breakup or do you feel like you're moving on? And do you even feel like there's a difference between those two things for you? I don't think coping is the word I would use anymore, but I do still think that it affects me. And I think there will always be little things that affect me from the breakup and just the relationships. So yeah, I don't think I'm coping anymore, but I'm also like not now and probably not ever going to just be 100% free of it. That's cool. Honestly, I don't know. I'd like to get there. I don't think I'm there where you're at right now. I'm just feeling I'm still coping with it, definitely. Yeah, it's like, I don't know. Like I don't know how I feel right now about it, but like it feels seems like until yesterday, I had to like, I had to really show up every day. Because it would for a long time, my day would just I would wake up and it should be confused. I'd just be like confused like how I ended up here, just like spiraling. So I had to justify it every day and then I had to convince myself to participate for a long time. And I think that lasted a few months. And then recently, I don't I think recently it's been a process of just like trying to trick myself into not thinking about it sometimes. Because I feel like I don't know for me, I feel like my body still felt that something was wrong, even though mentally I can justify it was like, I feel like the body has a memory of its own. So it just feels confused and sometimes I wake up in a days. It's obvious my mind was going in circles in my sleep. Just like, um, and but I think the big thing there that helped was just like being able to take it and stride. Because at first, it would just be very negative. Like, oh, why are you doing that? Why are you thinking about that? I told you not to, like, I told you not to think about her, you know? Like, but instead changing that to like, oh, that makes sense. Your body's going to remember she's important to you. So your brain is going to try to be like, oh, remember this person, why she not next to you? But yeah, but kind of just tricking it like, oh, yes, I know, that's terrible. Let's think about it later. Let's do this other thing right now. You know, like things like that, um, just taking it and stride. Sometimes I'll wake up and it's like, no, I need a day. I just, I can't do today. And I take, I just, if I'm working, I'll like work and then I'll cancel my plans and I'll just order, just order some Thai food from my favorite place here and just watch a movie and like, that's it. That's all I'll do. So just like that kind of stuff I still do from time to time. Yeah, that's kind of where I'm, but recently, like last couple weeks, last few weeks, I feel like I'm getting more into just living my life instead of worrying about all these things. But there are still days where I do have to deal with all this stuff. Yeah. Is that a satisfying answer for you? Yes. 85 out of 100. That's a B. That's a pass. Two different perspectives. That's a B versus that pass. Give me a fucking B. You're too low, bro. Got to be perfect, right? I think one thing I will say is like to people listening, like, one thing I really had to ask myself was like, that helped me go forward was like, just, do you like yourself? You know, do you like yourself? Do you like the life that you're living? Do you like the way that you think is it serving you? You know, because like, I think you'd really do have to separate your brain or I did. I had to separate my brain from myself because I don't know. I had to realize that your brain is a machine, right? Like, it's complicated, but it's a machine, right? It's like the way I like to think about as a consciousness is like a layer above it. And your brain works by like pattern recognition and reinforcing things, patterns that you have, right? And it helps us get through life. That's why it does these things. But sometimes like, these patterns hurt us. And so you have to like kind of sometimes show it that there's another way so that it can make that link and create that pattern. That's all. Also that shot of the, is that weed? That's my weed shot. Yeah. No, it's my candle. Not interested anymore. Actually, yeah, it was weed, sorry, my bad. Oh, man, I guess we're nearing the end, but I'm sorry. But, Gerard, thank you so much for joining us. Yeah. Thank you, Patrick. I know the stuff is, yes. I know the stuff is like not easy to talk about. Really appreciate you joining and having these conversations with us. I think a lot of people, I know I have gotten a lot of value out of it. I've been able to just listening to the way that you've dealt with things in your experience. It's given me perspective on mine too. And I'm sure we'll give a lot of other people a perspective too. So thank you. Hopefully we have another episode at some point. Well, I just wanted to also say thanks to you guys for like putting yourself out there genuinely. And like doing this because I think it's thing, a lot of things that people think about and feel like they're alone in thinking and feeling. And so it's super comforting, like somebody said, to know that it's not something that you're dealing with uniquely. And that other people are also going through it and have gotten through it. And so truly, thanks for putting yourself out there like that and being vulnerable. Thanks for saying that. We appreciate it. Yeah. That keeps us going. You know, stuff like that keeps us going. Thank you both for being like vulnerable and open about this. I mean, I can't imagine like how difficult it is. Yeah, I think it's, I mean, I know it's not something easy. Yeah, I just appreciate it a lot that you're both willing to be so open. All right. So this week's Art Pick. So the why is this an art to say it's so hard to say? Art of the episode. Art Pick. No. You know what we're not going to do of the, we're just going to say what is your art pick? I think that sounds way cleaner. Yes. What is your job? Drop the of the episodes. Yeah, it just doesn't work. So my art pick is the song Candy Necklaces by Lana Del Rey. Yeah, I just, like, I was really like die hard Lana like back in like Portadayra, like really early on and I kind of like dropped out for a while and by for a while, I mean, her entire career after that. And I started listening to her again with her new album, Pigeon Iver is a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard. And I've only listened to two songs from the album, but each song I've listened to is just like a pure work of genius in my opinion and like some of my favorite songs ever. So the first time I, the first song I listened to was A&W, which is like genuinely my favorite song ever. And then yeah, with Candy Necklaces, she's cute for two. And I feel like I've almost been like, I have so much hype in my mind, built up from these two songs I've been putting off listening to the album, but I just need a bite to pull it. I need to listen to it a lot more. I've heard a few songs. I really like the songs that I've heard. Yeah, so I need to get into it. I'll listen to the album too. Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know like a single artist who like depicts like trauma in like such a like open like vulnerable like insightful way, where it's like I've genuinely, I feel like learn things about myself. Sometimes just like listening to like some of her music. That's like the beauty of art. Yeah. Also her music just is just like good too, even if you don't listen to the lyrics like it's by like, like headphones on, so it's all packaged really. Yeah. I'm also going to do a song. So I heard this song again. I don't know if I've heard it before, but I heard it again when I watched a rival again. The song is called On the Nature of Daylight. Oh shit, I should know who's by one second. On the Nature of Daylight by Max Frickter, Luisa Fuller, and a bunch of other people. I'm not going to list it out, but um, it's like it's like an instrumental, um, you know, with a bunch of islands and stuff, but it's, it's such an introspective song. Though it's just like you really feel like you're in a movie when it's playing. Um, so I like play it sometimes. I'll play it in the shower. I'll play it on a monowalk. And it's just like it helps me just come to terms with where I'm at. And so yeah, it's that song. If you haven't heard it, like, I think they use it in a lot of things, but yeah, listen to it. Yeah. I don't know if I've heard that song specifically, but if you want another, like, album of like songs like that where they're like very like powerful instrumental songs, that can almost like cake you on an emotional voyage. Listen to Be Kundun soundtrack by Philip Glass. That's like one of my favorite instrumental like soundtrack song. I have two, but one of them is like truly my, my art artist art pick. And one of them I feel like it's just like such a good song in the context of like all the things that we've been talking about to just like listen and reflect them has been so monumental for me. So that song is both sides now by Joni Mitchell. If you haven't heard it, definitely take like listen to it. It just is such a good perspective building like song and she wrote it when she was like in her 20s, I think, and it's just unbelievable. So highly recommend. But my actual art pick is there's this artist called Lippafa. And the album is called Jagu. And it's just like Viby, Daisy kind of inspired but also like trans type of music. It is so good. Highly recommend. I love trans. Yeah. We have to listen. Yeah. Okay, so wake up by envelope. Is that for example? Yes, exactly. Oh, fun. That's a fun name, Lippafa. That's a fun name. Cool. I guess that's it. Thank you guys. Peace. Bye. If you're still listening, I know we talked a lot about what we figured out in our journeys throughout the call and how we've dealt with things. But I just want to say that going through all this stuff is difficult. And there are moments, far more moments that I'm proud of honestly, where I feel weak and helpless like I'm falling into an endless pit. So if you're in the bottom half of a wave or going through a really shitty time, please, please give yourself grace. It's okay. You're not weak. You're not left behind. You're not insignificant. You have value. Please trust that the world will catch you and that you will catch yourself and allow yourself to be vulnerable around those you trust. And it's not like once you accept these things that will be okay. It won't, but it will give you the strength to go through it, to feel it out, to be sad. Things will get better and then they will get worse, but then they get better again. And you will probably forget to give yourself grace when they do get worse. But then you remind yourself of all these things again and they will get easier. So peace and love and remember, you're the sky, not the storm.
