 Hello friends, welcome to the Blood Rotation. Are you ready? Too late. Past the joint. It's the obligatory awkward intro again. Just hit the ground running. Never think about it beforehand. Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Pineapple Blood Rotation. Welcome back everyone. This is number six. I hope everyone's enjoying this hot summer. My God. Summer of not like us. Summer of espresso. Summer of what else, man? What else is this summer? Summer of literal heat. Literal heat. Yes. Musical, hei-he, and literal heat. My God, I'm fucking melting over here. It's like 90 degrees in Seattle. And this man has it even worse. Yeah, New York has been pretty rough last couple of weeks. It's just so, so hot, especially at night. That's the thing, man. That's the thing you don't appreciate it about the West Coast. Not even the way. I can't even say West Coast, but just California. Yeah. It doesn't matter if it's 110 degrees in the day, like at night, at least it's. Cools down. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Even here, it's usually like, okay, night. Seattle's in like, in that, it's like kind of like a value, right? Because of the Olympics on the, yeah, on the West. So it kind of traps the heat. Oh, yeah. That's a little fucking over here. People don't realize this, but in Seattle is like, it's like three hours from the ocean. It's not, it's not on the Pacific Ocean by any means. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the Puget Sound. There's a lot of bodies of water, but it's not. And they are connected to the Pacific Ocean, but it's, it's not, it's not truly a coastal city. Coastal, yeah. That's like the whole, I feel like the whole like sound system is like so interesting. And as well, I like the weather is like all like fucking over here. Because it's like, yeah, it's not like coastal, like weather in like a traditional sense. It's just like, yeah, the sound, like bring like a, the sound brings in almost like a, some like coastal, like, like ocean breezes and stuff. But then like, like you were saying, it gets strapped in by like the cascades and like the Olympics. Very interesting. Like in like September, October, if you go like a little bit to the east where like Yakima is and those. Yeah, it's so much warmer. Like Seattle will be like 60 degrees maybe in the day, 55, but you go to like Yakima and it's like, we're spoke can and it's like 70. Yeah, it's like the same latitude, same everything. It's just like water. Yeah. How is it? I guess I've never been to like the coast of Seattle. I wonder, I mean, not the coast of Seattle, the coast of Washington. I wonder how the weather is over there. Well, I mean, it's just Golder. Golder. Yeah, it's a little bit closer. Yeah, I guess I don't know what I could close here to like San Francisco. Yeah, I go there when we need to escape the heat. Have you been holding it, man? Have things been for you recently? I've been in the fucking heat. Things have been interesting. I mean, it's been a, it's definitely been an interesting couple months. I think I'm definitely like understanding a lot of things that somehow like a lot of things that have been dealing with for a long time. Yeah. There's just like a part of me, but just understanding them a little bit better. And just spending time kind of going through it. And, but I mean, other than that, it's been, it's been fun. It's been lots of people visiting in and out in New York, you know, so showing them around, going to reconnecting with people and connecting with new people as well. It's all been, it's all been a big, a big chaos. You know, it's, it's, it's a lot of, it's a lot of stuff going on. Yeah. Even from a creative perspective, just trying a lot of different things. Yeah, yeah. This podcast included. Yeah. So it's been good chaotic. Yeah. And all the bad stuff is stuff that needs to be. Come out. Explored. Yeah. Yeah, I got it too. How are you? I'm here. Oh, man, I'm in a very similar place. But very chaotic, but also in a very productive way. So I actually, I'm actually on leave for work right now. Yeah. Like there's a lot that's been come that came up in my life. Like a lot of like, just like emotions and like trauma that I wasn't being like open and honest with myself about. And over the last few months, like that kind of all just hit me at once. But like, it's been a lot. It's been very intense. Like, finally, like feeling all of that and processing all of that. But at the same time, like, it's something that was like very necessary where it's like, I feel like for, for like literally years, like I felt almost like, trapped. Like, there were like fundamental things about my life that I knew I wasn't like being honest with myself about and like fundamental, like, like, yeah. And just these fundamental problems that I feel like we're holding me back. And I finally feel like now that I can see them clearly in process them. Like I can start to deal with them. So like, I've like things have been really like chaotic in my life. There have been like so many changes. Like I really think I've changed more in like the last few months than I have in like literally years. But I'm very happy about it. And even though like it is like very intense, like going through all of this. Like once when I first started like realizing and like processing this stuff, like when it like first hit me, like literally for like three or four days. Like I would get like maximum like one one and a half hours of sleep every night. And like there were multiple nights where I like just couldn't sleep at all. And I would just like spend most of the day just like sobbing because like I was finally allowing myself to feel like that hurt in that pain in a way that like I had never let myself before. So it's been like like I said, like very intense dealing with all of this stuff, but at the same time, like I feel like more free and more in control of my life and myself. Then I have like maybe ever. So yeah, intense but in a good way. That's great, man. I'm glad to hear it all. I mean, even though it's really. Sounds like a really gruesome process. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a lot. It's definitely cathartic. I mean, that's why I had to go out of leave for work. It's like I was trying to like balance all this while keeping in track of the work. And I was just like, no, this is not this is not going to happen when it's like 90% of my brain space is just being occupied like dealing with all this stuff. But yeah. It's like a like I always say like for me, it's the problems and like the issues that I feel like I can't acknowledge and I can't recognize that scared me more than the ones that I'm dealing with. It's so much better to like finally get a grasp on this stuff like after like I said, like years of feeling like having these feelings and not being able to understand where they were coming from. Like feeling like I was holding myself back in so many ways and not understanding what. I make sense like just being able to put a name on things. Yeah, like, oh, that's that's why this is happening. That's why I feel like that. Yeah. It's just so powerful. Yeah. Yeah. Questioning it. Yeah, exactly. Because before identifying it, it's like you feel it and you're second guessing yourself if you're supposed to be feeling something like that. Yeah. Or if there's something just or you're just being a baby, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You you blame yourself for like having the feelings that you're feeling. And once you're you finally have like clarity about that. It's like, okay, like you were saying, right? Like you, you can stop blaming yourself and start working on like actually dealing with things. And that clarity like matters so much. Yeah. Is there anything anything you want to share? Um, I don't know. I think I'm still kind of like going through it in terms of like this was a feelings like I said, like I think it's just like a lot of trauma that I wasn't being like open with myself about. And I think it is very much tied into like a. Yeah, like it's it's about like. Like you were saying like being able to recognize like how much certain things from my past were still affecting me. Even though like like after like so many years, it feels like, oh, I should be over these things. Oh, like why am I letting it affect me so much. And a lot of times like I wouldn't even realize like that's what was affecting me. So I would just blame myself for these like unhealthy like habits, these like patterns that I would fall into. And so it's like on one hand, like being able to understand and accept like how much those things still hurt me to a certain extent. But on the other hand, like acknowledging like the ways in which I've been like almost like hurting myself by like blaming myself for like feeling that way in the first place. Yeah, yeah, I'd say like those are really the two biggest things that I've been like, yeah, wrestling with like I said, first specifics. Yeah, I'm still to it's so too raw for me to really like express directly. Yeah, you're feeling guilty for not guilty. I feel like I suppressed a lot of stuff for a long time. And obviously because in part, I didn't understand it. Also in part because I was supposed to I had this idea of I had this idea that I was supposed to be happy and I was supposed to be content with my life, especially when I was in my last relationship. I don't know, I feel like I wouldn't I would share things within that relationship, but in a way that preserved the I don't know, it's almost like if you were to say, if you're in a relationship and you were to come and say, hey, I'm something is wrong. I'm depressed, something. Yeah, something is I'm dealing with some stuff. It's like you always feel guilty for doing it because it points a finger to the fact that maybe I don't know where I'm going with this. No, I mean, I kind of like get what you're pointing at. And I think like what you're saying about guilt like that is like a huge part of what was preventing me from understanding like how I was feeling in the first place. I really feel like, yeah, like that was that was what prevented me from like really processing how I was feeling for so long because on one hand these things would be so painful and they would hurt so much. But then I would feel like guilty and I would feel like dumb and I feel stupid for for hurting so much and for like having for like still holding onto that pain. And I would almost like beat myself up over it and it was like I feel guilty for hurting but at the same time like that prevented me from and I would like I would obviously acknowledge that on some level, but I would never really let myself feel that pain and I would almost like beat myself up over it. And then like there was also this extra layer of guilt like I said because like like it was almost like by not acknowledging it and not processing it like I did things which also hurt me and I did things which should hurt the people around me and that would even like fuel the guilt even more and it would feel like, oh, like this is all your fault because like you're still holding onto this hurt in this pain. Like you should be over it when it was like the issue was that I was never really letting myself acknowledge how much it hurt in the first place and how much it hurt to like continue beating myself up over it. I think what I was talking about the idea that you're supposed to be happy, you know what do you mean? You have you have this amazing person in your life. Like not just person. I don't want to start with that even you have this you've gone this great education, you know, you have this good job. You have this amazing person in your life, this person that you see that you respect and you love and everyone around you respects and loves and you have a good relationship. And even besides all that, there's something wrong. Yeah. And to kind of it's like really hard to acknowledge it, talk about it and let yourself feel it. Yeah. Have you ever felt like, you know, you don't necessarily like you don't feel long somewhere. Oh, yeah. I'm 100%. So it's been it's interesting. I used to feel a lot like that especially especially because I've moved around a lot. I think I would find myself in these situations where you know, you kind of feel like an outsider. And it's kind of hard to break into, you know, social groups and stuff like that. Even beyond that, I think let's say, let's say you come to, it comes to your knowledge that there is a, there is a group chat. There is a group chat like you're not in classic classic, the classic. And you feel like you're supposed to be in it because it's like all these people that are in your life. And you trust and consider your own. And let's say you're not in, and you find out that there's a group chat that you're not in. I don't know. For me, I used to feel like, I'm falling like suddenly. But I couldn't even explain it then. And I think I can explain it now. Finally, after realizing it, but it was like, it was like I was falling like I'm like not supported. There's gaping. There's this whole that forms in my chest. Yeah. And it's just like kind of like panic mode. Yeah. And I don't really know what to do, what to say to anyone. Like I'm just really anxious about it. And it's like suddenly you're questioning if these people even like you are not. Yeah. And so I feel like I used to, I used to feel that a lot. Yeah. But last week, last week something happened. And it happened first time in a while that I came across this situation where I found that. And there's, you know, someone mentioned some group chat with some people from you guys from college. And I wasn't in it. Obviously, we are. I would have known the context that was being talked about. So normally the same thing. I would have gone into panic mode. Yeah. Like my world would have started crashing. Yeah. And I felt an initial, this time I felt like an initial like slight shock. But then I was able to just hold myself and be like, hey, like, you know, maybe, maybe you don't. And that's okay. Like I think it's okay because you fit in all these other places. Maybe you fit there. And I was just able to see that a little bit like, oh, okay, maybe. Yeah, that makes sense to me. This, and you have to, I mean, you have to trust the people around you too. You know, like you, yeah. That like that nobody has ill intentions, right? Like sometimes, sometimes people forget. Sometimes. Yeah. But more than that is just you, maybe you don't know. More than that is just you, maybe you don't fit there. And that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. You're supposed to fit in every place, right? Yeah. You're my definition. You're unique. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got you. It's funny that you mentioned that because I think that that exact feeling that you're talking about is part of what made me realize all of this and come to all this realizations, which is just like. Like you were saying that feeling of like a falling of that like hole. Like, just in yourself, like, I realized that that like that feeling was almost like this like emptiness in myself, like this hole in my, this hole were like myself worth should have been. And I realized that the reason why things like that would make me so anxious would make me feel like so bad about myself was because I didn't truly believe that like my worth, my life and myself like. I had value. And so when I wasn't included in all of these things, like if I didn't fit in somewhere, that was almost like proof to me. It's like if I couldn't be everything to everyone, it was like my entire like self worth would like crumble. And it would feel like it was proof that like I didn't have value. Like people don't actually want that around. And that emptiness was like that emptiness in myself, like growing because I would see something like that. And I think that like like you're saying like now that I've finally realized that and I'm finally aware, like that feelings kind of like just dissolved because like I can recognize that now and like acknowledge that like no it's okay. Like I can resist that part of myself and have like confidence like like you're saying like trust that like no like people wouldn't like have me around like if they didn't actually like value me and they didn't appreciate having me around like. Yeah, yeah, like that's definitely like a huge part of like what I've been realizing that's you're right. It's the self worth. Yeah, that's that's it to like that self worth is oftentimes it's just placed in your the people around you. How the people around you perceive you right there validation. There validation and if you find in it's like you're constantly looking for places where that validation isn't satisfied right. Yeah, you take that as a sign that something wrong. You're not enough. Yeah, exactly. And it's almost like I like I valued my own life and my own opinion so little that it was like the only way that I could show to myself that I had any worth or value was from other people from their validations. When in reality like I need to like value my own life I need to value like my own interest and passions and be like if even if like tons of people like don't like me like as long as like I should have like security in myself in my own value right. Is there a different framework that like what is the what is the learning here exactly right like yeah like we can say now having seen other places. Right. Yeah. You can say okay it's okay that I don't fit there because I fit in all these other places right and I will continue to find other places that I fit in. But when you're in an environment like school. Yeah. You're surrounded by a lot of the same kind of people. Yeah. Not just same kind of people but like one or two different ideals in which you have to fit. Yeah. Throughout school even even in college like if you didn't have a diverse group of friends like for me like I had some friends like around but my core group was my core the core people I knew where all people in tech from the Bay area right. So it was like a very like insular. Yeah limiting you know like limiting perspective limiting. I love them all to death but it's yeah. But I think it prevented me from experiencing different ways of thinking different different different types of people different. Yeah. And seeing like how I would have fit in those situations and I would I might have fit better if I might have fit in different ways that I had it. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know exactly what you're talking about and I think like the I mean there's just like so much there about like almost like the relationship between like your own sense of self and like the environment you're in because it's like if you're in like a certain community or a certain environment. There's certain like there's always going to be like certain ideals or certain models for like how you should live your life. Like that you're going to judge yourself against you know how certain people like for example if they're in a very stressful like a very toxic environment. And then you're going to be able to sort of like give into that and sort of go along with it and some people almost like rebellion sit and like fight back. Like for me, I feel like those two different like ways of reacting to that are very much tied to your own like sense of self worth and how willing you are to stand up for yourself. Like if you're very like secure in like your own value as a person, then you're going to be able to say like no like fuck off like just because I don't fit this ideal like I don't need to do that. But I think for like the vast majority of people like you're saying like most people like like get and I think like it's almost unavoidable for a sense to a certain extent like humans are social animals right. So like like value the opinions of others and like if that is important to us. So I think like yeah like you're saying like that can be very hard it can be very hard to like have trust in your own value and trust have trust in yourself and even like figure out again like oh like who am I really what sort of environments do I fit into if like you only have this like one sided like context or community that you live in. I think that's why a lot of people find themselves like for example in college because they're finally forced out of that environment and they're like oh there are other ways of living there are these other communities that I can fit into and like maybe that's where I actually belong. And I think that's why a lot of people get that in college but I don't think it's necessarily just that like for me at least like I get that a lot from like art or like philosophy where a lot of times like things like that can also give you such a different experiences and like insight into like different experiences and perspectives that can kind of be a different way of life. And then I think that's one of the things that I think that's one of the things that I think I think that's one of the things that I think is a different kind of perspective that can kind of make you like realize more about yourself. It relies more about the world and more about like where exactly you fit in and I think like for me like all of those things have kind of like fit in and like been a part of like me like coming to be secure and who I am like coming even to realize like who I really am and like the sorts of like communities and environments that I fit into. And that answers what you were asking me. You have to realize like the way you're living is an option. Exactly. And you don't really see that until you talk to people from other backgrounds. And that you say college I don't think it to have really happened for me in college. It's happened to me mostly in the last year if I'm being really honest like I met so many people in the city in New York that you know just different things matter to them. The things that matter to them day to day is just a little bit different. And I'm saying New York, but I mean on my travels I can met so many people from Europe even within Europe between different countries even within the same country with your people are different from different parts of the world. You know people in Costa Rica are different. It's just like talking to them, understanding what issues they face, what problems they have, what makes them happy. You know what that makes them happy with them, makes them content. Just learning all that puts all of your this framework that you've been living life with in perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just that it's just a framework that you are free as a human being to modify at your own will. No, I'm just saying. But you don't even realize that until you go out and talk to these people. Oh, 100%. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely feel the same way. Yeah, I wouldn't say that really happened for me in college either. Like, yeah, it's definitely more of something that's happened afterwards. And I think like it like those conversations almost come from like a variety of perspectives. Like I think like therapy was a huge thing of sort of like breaking out of the cage of my mind. Like breaking out of like my own perspective and like limitations. I was placing on myself talking to other people like you said from like different like backgrounds. Like seeing like, oh, like seeing how differently people look at things. Seeing like like even being able to realize that like, oh, like I didn't even really like realize doing something like that was. Like I didn't like I was so like stuck in my perspective that it didn't even come to me as a possibility that like I could look at things the certain way or I could live my life a certain way. Like like you were saying like having those different perspectives again, like listening to like songs are like listening to like podcasts. Like engaging with like pieces of art, which ever again, like giving me these like huge insights into like ways of life that like I had just don't understand. Like for example, one of my favorite like a youtubers is this like he's like an art critic who when he started his channel, he was like he literally worked at a pizza place. Like he was like a blue collar worker like barely like affording to like pay for a home. He lived in his van like just doing van life like driving around like the US and like he's got into this place that like we're now like just because like he's so like thoughtful and he has like such interesting like perspectives. Like he literally makes like 120k a year like off his Patreon and like it's so interesting like getting that sort of perspective from someone like that where it's like someone who's like struggled their whole life. Like to get to a position where that we almost like take for granted and like the sorts of perspectives they have on things like Silicon Valley and like that sort of Bay Area culture that we take for granted. Like yeah, like you're saying like I feel like those like all of these like these are all just different ways of like having conversations with other people and like getting insights into those perspectives. Like it was that it was also just I feel like I wasn't open to the world. I just wasn't I had my I had kind of decided what things added. I don't know if I had decided or they were decided for me. I don't I don't know but you know it was me it was my family my career my my girlfriend and my framework for what a perfect life was and that was it. And that was something else mattered and my all of my security and my comfort light within those parameters. Yeah. And somehow like within those parameters I managed to become so neurotic about my entire fucking life. Yeah. Even though like that was it. And maybe because that was it that I was. I never fixed say unlike how perfect my life had to be everything had to be a certain way. Yeah. And I was just was not. Open to anything else anything else when I tried to inject anything else. How the outside of those five things it would just overwhelm the fuck out of me. Yeah, like it was like I couldn't I just couldn't make space for anything else right. Like working out like and I would try to do it but I would always be so frustrated because I was. and fit it in. I know exactly how you feel, dude. Holy shit. And it would just cause so much anxiety. And then my world would start crumbling. Do you know, I know that's literally like, exactly what I've been realizing. It's like, I had this idea of like, of like what my life was like, the sorts of things I needed to do. And it's like, I would obsess over getting them perfect. But then it's like, that never actually gave me any peace or happiness. Like that was like all it did was make me more frustrated. Like, and more angry at myself, because it would feel like, oh, like, I could never get anything right. And I would think that, oh, it's your fault because you're not doing these things well enough. You're not doing it. Like, there's obviously some problem with you for not being able to do these things perfectly. When the issue was like you're saying, the fact that I needed that level of control, that level of obsessiveness about like, okay, my life has to be this way. I have to live it this way. It needs to be exactly this way. Or like, I think like there was like a level of guilt related to that because like, I think that almost made me dismissive of other people's perspectives for a long time, where it's like, I wasn't really letting myself listen to other people. And like the wisdom that they had, because like, I was so certain about like what I knew, what was already decided in my head. Yeah, I wouldn't give myself like the ability to like, open up to what other people were trying to tell me. And again, like, I think that's related so much to like, what I was saying about like that guilt, that like, cycle of like hurting myself and getting frustrated and just this like self-destructive process, where I could obviously tell I wasn't treating people in my life the best. I wasn't treating myself the best. And that would only cause me to like, feed it into that ideal even more and more. That part you said about not being able to see the others. Yeah. Like, receive the other people who was to be really in a way that I found myself in so many like, you know, arguments over the years. Because I think a lot of it points back to the fact that, yeah, I wasn't able to, I had decided what mattered. And yes, I could say like, yes, definitely there might be an element of being selfish in there. But also like, also if I'm being completely honest, it wasn't in my head like I had whatever I had figured out, whatever was in my framework. Yeah. I want it to give that to other people. I didn't want them to make those mistakes, right? Yeah. I wanted to, and it came out of, and it's funny because those arguments happen with the people that I love the most because I wanted to help them the most. I wanted to give them the most. Laterally. You know, give them as much as I could. And it just caused so much pain. Yeah, it's so much, so much pain, so much conflict. I know exactly what you mean. It's like I was so sure about those things. Like, I mean, exactly what you said. Yeah, I was so sure about those things that I would get like so frustrated. Like you were saying, the people I cared about, I cared about would like make these mistakes when the mistake was me feeling that way in the first place. Yeah, it's like, hey, I already figured this out. You don't have to make this mistake. Just, you know, just do this. Yeah. But no, like really realizing that a couple of things, I mean, just being open, but also just realizing that like, everyone's playing the same game you are. Yeah. Everyone's acting already acting in their own. Yeah. That's interesting. And I think, I think the other thing is I wasn't able to understand a lot of times like, you know, someone around me said they were anxious or, yeah, or, or, or, or wasn't able to bring themselves to do something that, you know, that needed to be done. Um, I couldn't understand it because, because I was not, I couldn't understand my own anxiety at all, because I just pushed it away like it was nothing. Yeah. So I was in my head, it was just like, why can't we just don't just do the same thing? Because I had found success doing that. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't out of nothing. Like it was like, I was getting all this positive reinforcement for doing that. Yeah, exactly. That's, that's like, that's the world we're in, right? You get positive, you get positive reinforcement from your environment, from yourself. And it's like, maybe it only works like 20% of the time, but that's always like, at least for me, like what I would think about, right? You never really have like that perspective to take a step back and be like, okay, is this actually helping me? It sucks, man. I wish. I don't know. Like this is, you learn things when you learn things, you know? Yeah. There is definitely, I do feel regret. And I'm like, man, I wish I was better, you know, or I wish I was like, I wish I was able to see things in a different way. Yeah. Because I can't question my intentions. I know I've always had good intent. Like I feel like for me, especially like that regret that you're talking about. Like I didn't want to accept like the ways in which like I had hurt other people and hurt myself. Like when I fuck something up, I would like obviously like try and think it through and like see what I would do better, but I would almost dismiss. I'd be like, okay, like I obviously I made a mistake, but then I understand like what to do from here on out. Like it's okay, like the only thing I can do like is move on and like move forward. But I was really like, I didn't want to come to terms with like the ways in which like I was saying, like I was hurting other people and the ways in which like that was also like hurting myself. And like again, like I think that's what I've really been trying to like feel more and like being more in touch with is like like those regrets and those hearts and those pains. And like even like I think a lot of times like when they're self-inflicted, yeah, like being more compassionate in kind towards myself and being more compassionate in kind towards others. They are so connected. They are. I'm realizing I'm realizing sometimes I acted like a dick because I acted like a dick to myself. Yeah, literally. It wasn't that was truly now I'm realizing because a lot of times like something would happen and I would say something and I would do something that and then later I'd be like, why are you so inconsiderate? Why are you so mean? You know, why don't you have more empathy? You know, I mean, why don't you understand really? Yeah, I didn't know I didn't know how to do it to myself. Like I in a lot of ways in a lot of ways, I think I was more empathetic towards others than I was 100% by a lot, but but even if that's true, like until you understand yourself, you can't understand someone else. Oh, 100%. You just can't. Now that's actually a so like one of my favorite philosophers is Nietzsche and like there's always been this aspect and like his thought, which like has like rubbed me the wrong way, which is like this idea that like you can't like truly be altruistic unless you're like egoistic to a certain extent or like if you like value yourself and like I feel like I was always like I would always like push back against them and be like, oh, like that's kind of like a selfish way to look at things that's kind of like narcissistic, but I kind of I feel like more and more that that that fucker was right all along where it's like if I didn't if I don't love myself, I can't ever love other people like it's always going to bleed out like in my relationships with other people and like you're saying like I would be more compassionate towards other people and like when other people like there were definitely times where like people made mistakes that I would beat myself up over and I wouldn't I would obviously be more compassionate towards them and I'd be like, oh, it's fine. Like I'm obviously hard towards myself, but I'm like I'm more empathetic towards others because like you know like I would almost think about it as in like, oh, I would like I have control over like my own actions so I should be harder on myself versus for other people I don't know what they're struggling with. So it's like I should be like more empathetic, but obviously like you're saying like there's no clean way to like divide those two things and it did cause me to be like cruel and to be like like resentful and bitter and like toxic towards other people in ways that I wasn't being honest with myself about because again like it all just came out of that like self-hatred it just came out of all that like pain I would put towards myself. Is there even now like even now the fucking that voice in my head you know I've always it's like even this thing that I've learned I want to like spread it you know what I mean I want everyone to know I want I'm thinking like why don't we teach children this stuff like why and it's yeah I'm not saying we shouldn't I'm just saying that immediately I jump to that again. Yeah. Yeah. There's such a there's such a fine line between like wanting to help other people and almost like a savior complex where you assume like oh I know I know it's best for you like oh why don't you just listen to me that's like uh I mean I told you right like listening back to like mr. Morale like the Kendrick album is almost like a new like album after like processing all of this because that's essentially what he's talking about on the album like his own savior complex and like how much that was like based on like his own lack of self-worth his own self-hatred how like him saying like oh I am not your savior is like him pushing back against that like impulsant himself to like impose his own judgments and his own like way of looking at the world on other people. I just I just watched this movie. Yeah. Both kinds of kindness. But I want to watch it. Hellabed. It's like the same guy who made four things. I'll be honest I don't know how I feel about the movie as I as a as a whole. Yeah. I think it was too much for me. Yeah. But the first story the first story so it's an anthology split into three different stories. And the first story was probably the one that I found the most interesting because I saw qualities in it that I've seen in myself. Yeah. Obviously blown up to the extreme though. Yeah. The first story there's this character who's kind of like life is based on decisions that this boss or this master deems perfect right. Yeah. So this guy is the one who decides what he's going to drink. Yeah. What he's going to eat what when he's going to have sex. When he's going to you know what he's going to do on a day to day basis. Yeah. And like even if he like even if he like couldn't raise some preference over something there's always a right answer. Yeah. Corrective. Oh. Oh I'm feeling vodka. I think a whiskey would be more suitable. That I don't you. Yeah. Yes. And it's like kind of the same idea. It's like the idea of perfection right. Yeah. It's not just for yourself. You're projecting that onto everyone around you because you know the way to go. They've figured it out for them already. Yeah. It comes out of a combination of ego and love. Yeah. And like to really understand it you can't deny that there's an altruistic part of it. Yeah. 100%. But realizing that there's so much that's lost between that. There's so much individuality that's lost. There's so much agency that's lost. Yeah. What you deemed perfect is only perfect in a certain context for a certain person. And chances are that's probably not even perfect. You're just you've just decided for some reason. Yeah. Yeah. It's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like the most valuable things in life are like the things where it's like that defy your expectations right. Where it's like you when you like right off something is being valuable. And then you get this new perspective. And suddenly you like almost look at the whole world like in a new way. And if you come into like life with the perspective that like, oh, I know how things are like I know. Like what perfection looks like. I know like how things should be like that'll prevent you from like ever like recognizing like those those unique things. Those things that can challenge you and surprise you like the things that make life like so vibrant and beautiful in the first place. It's beautiful because there's so many options. There's so many different options. Everything is a correct option if you think about it. Like there's another movie man. I really want to I want to share this. There's this movie that I saw. It's a really old movie. But I saw it last week. It's called adaptation. Yeah. You've heard of it? Oh, yeah. I want to watch it a lot. I know it's about. I had no idea. I just saw I just saw. Oh, did you go in blind? Yeah, I just saw some real about it. I was like, oh, it's Nicholas Cage. I love Nicholas Cage. Yeah. And Maril Street. So it's like, it'll be good to watch. And I just I found it so fascinating because yeah, yeah. The movie is about Nicholas Cage. Yeah. It's about this it's about this neurotic self-conscious man who just doesn't know how to like let anything be, right? Yeah. He's like, he's so hyper focused on what feels right. Yeah. You know, just dialed up to the extreme. Like it's just what's perfect? What is the best way to go about this? Yeah. Creating, you know, how do I create something profound? Not but not fantastical. There has to be original. It can't be derivative. It's got to be it's got to be just right. He's got this Goldilocks complex. Yeah. And it's like that's what the movie is about. And I just I relate it to it not to that level but to the the basic feeling that was driving all of this. Yeah. It's just like let's say there's like a crevice on the ground. Right. And you're like trying to like roll the ball into the crevice. Yeah. Like a small depression. And you roll it there and you know, it's like your cast, your net, you make your decision. Whatever it is. And nine times out of ten, it stinks. But because of that one time, it didn't. You find a reason for it and you're like, no, that was fucked up. That was perfect. So now you take so much longer deciding how to roll the ball. Yeah. What cat for it to take. And once you build up enough fucking courage to even throw it, that's not that's not it doesn't even end there. Then like when it stops you start toying with it. We go up to it and you start toying with it. Yeah. Oh, could it be could it fit better? Yeah. Or perfect. You start fucking with it. It's something a little to the left, a little to the right. You just pop it up. Yeah. And it's like, that's the, this is the pizza that I was talking about in the last episode. So this is the, this is the, this is the music in the car. When I keep adjusting the knob. Oh, yeah. The volume is exactly perfect. Is it exactly right? You know, no, that's too much. Yeah. That's that's one level too much. Yeah. But and it would just bother me so much. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I saw all those pieces of me in this character. And I was just like, man, wow. Yeah. That's that, that thing you're saying about the volume. I've, I literally view that so often, especially with like, with like songs that I care about. Like, like my favorite songs ever. Like whenever I try to listen to them, I'm like, oh, the setting needs to be exactly perfect. I need to like make sure the volumes like completely are right. Like, yeah, I spent so much time on that where it's like, I almost don't like a lot of times. Like I'm so fixated on like trying to get everything perfect that I miss. Like the things I love about this song. Like I'm just not mentally engaged in that. Because I'm so focused on getting all of those like small elements perfect that I like to lose out on like what I was even there in the first place really. Dude, I thought I thought there was something wrong with me. I thought it was just me that did this. And I would be, I would be conscious about the fact that I'm doing that. No, literally. And I would get, I would get so frustrated with myself where I'm like, oh, why are you even doing this? Why are you aiming for perfection? And then I would get sidetracked thinking about that. And then like, I'm still not thinking about the song, right? I'm still not actually engaged with what I wanted to do in the first place. It's just my mind like coiling up on itself over and over again. Just like further and further, like layers of like, like analysis of like what I'm doing as opposed to like being engaged in like what I want to do. I think lost in your own head. Yeah. 100%. In hypersensitive to your surroundings. I don't even think it's being hypersensitive to your surroundings. So much as it is being hypersensitive to like yourself in your own mind. Like I think it very much is like again, like what like we're talking about. Like this feeling that of like needing perfection. Like that comes fundamentally again from like that place of like place of not being half okay with yourself being imperfect. Like all of that. Like just this like constant obsessive need for everything to be right. And like yeah, I think like that's something that I've been working on a lot. Like recently is like trying to force myself to get out of my head. And I feel like that's really what's been helping with that. Like that's why I've been like going out like paddle boarding and stuff like that more. Because I feel like things like that. If I do something like very physically like intensive, like that's one of the only things that can sort of force me to get out of that like headspace sometimes. It's hard though. It's like 100%. Because you're almost trying to convince your brain to like kill itself. You know what I mean? Like yeah, yeah. It's 100%. You kind of have to trick it right? It's like yeah. Got this thing recently about how a lot of us see refuge in our minds. Yeah. But that's not the same mind becomes a prison. Yeah. You don't want to leave really. And I feel like I felt that. I'm understanding that in the way that I never have before. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. No, I've definitely felt that a lot like like what you were saying about your mind like killing itself. Like that's very that phrase itself is like like sticks out to me a lot because like I think for a long time I almost associated who I was with like being in my head to a certain extent where it felt like wrong to get out of my head where it felt like I was like giving up something about myself. And I feel like even now like I almost like maybe this isn't the most healthy way to think about it. But I almost think of it as like trying to like destroy my mind or like like trying to like just like like one that like I was saying like when I do these physical activities. It's like I'm trying to get myself so exhausted that like my literally don't have energy to like be in my head where I'm like literally trying to annihilate like my mind. But at the same time like I think as I've been getting more comfortable with that like I'm realizing how regiubinating that is I'm realizing that like oh like I am not my mind like like and that like my mind is just as much like a prison like like you were saying for like myself and like my being. Like as opposed to being everything that I am like I am just as much like my body and like my experiences and my senses. But I would spend so long in my head that it felt like all I was was my thoughts and like my mind. And I think like that's what like also what things like meditation are like focused at where it's about like being able to see your thoughts and so being able to acknowledge that like underneath my thoughts is like my experience is like the true like core of my experience like my thoughts are aspect of my experience but I am not my thoughts my thoughts are just another part of like my being and that there's nothing wrong with like being outside of them and like being disconnected from them. Yeah it's been it's been quite a it's been quite a journey of learning how to yeah get out of it yeah yeah just exist without thinking yeah I've been happy with the fact that recently I'm starting to like forget things sometimes yeah yeah and I'm like wow I I forgot that and that it sounds so weird to be happy about it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but it means that like I'm no longer holding on really tightly to like all my thoughts and like yeah yeah yeah just existing and by nature of doing that you will forget right yeah you can't do everything that you've ever thought of like it's not gonna stay in your head like that's not the arrangement to do yeah that's what a computer is meant to do yeah yeah so that's been I would actually tell people before it was like I want to I want to forget yeah yeah yeah yeah I wouldn't know I got you yeah for me like it was definitely like almost this anxiety where I was like so afraid I would forget something that I really cared about in that like I was afraid like oh if I don't keep track of everything like what if like I fuck something up or what if I forget about something important when it was like first of all like if I care about it that much I'm going to remember like or like I can like write it down or like there's lots of different things that I can do right like it's not like I need like yeah like there's no need to like obsess and like get so anxious about that and also again like just being comfortable with being like okay like I forgot something that's like inevitable like there's nothing wrong with that like it's not like I need to cling on to like every like experience every like thought that I have yeah and it's like I think it's almost like counterproductive where a lot of times like I would be so afraid of like forgetting things that like I would be in my head and actually forget to do things and like actually like make things that I cared about yeah no yeah I definitely feel better like what is this what is what is the if you are not your thought the fuck are you like what's left like this this stream of consciousness that we have yeah if we're not actively thinking about it is it even fucking there like I don't yeah yeah it's so trippy man how do you think about it yeah it's crazy but that's almost like something I've also been realizing which is like so much of like our thought is like unconscious right it's like just because we're not like consciously like thinking about something doesn't mean that we aren't like assessing the world around us and that we're not aware of it right like I think I've been trying to replace this idea that like I am my thoughts with like I am like my experience you know like when we just sit there and we like let our thought die down like like our thoughts are just one aspect of our experience right but our experience is also our senses like like drinking in like the world around us the feelings sensations of our own body like all of those things are an aspect of our experience and that's like really like what we are like not just our thought do you think it's a is a result of being too meta too early on you know what I mean where it's like where it's like because you start thinking about it I feel like I feel like there was a certain sense when I did as I was growing up thinking about my thoughts and stuff yeah being lost in it I found it to be like a quality like a positive thing yeah you know made me more aware of my surroundings made me more like I would say someone would say mature yeah but then that turned I feel like that that turned into it distracting from my life yeah and I wonder if it's if it's because because of the fact that you know some people develop an obsession with this early on in their lives without yeah no I don't think you're so much positive feedback yeah keep doing it I don't like I definitely think there is an aspect where it's like almost this like maladaptive behavior but I don't know if it's like necessarily like like I do I do think there's an aspect of positive feedback but I almost feel like it's more of like a coping mechanism with like with like struggles like at least for me like I think like with like a lot of like trauma and stuff for my past like one way I would escape it was sort of like I would sort of like live in my own head and I would like think about like things outside of that and almost just like like it was like I would just like stay in my head to avoid like dealing with how I would feel emotionally and like deal like feel like feel physically like all of this like tension that was building up and so like it was definitely this like maladaptive response that's like I've carried on and I think like that can go for like any mental health like issue right like if you're dealing struggling with anxiety or something a lot of times like you start thinking about it as a way of managing that anxiety or managing like your feelings of depression or something and so like that can that can end up like there can be positives to that right like if you're worried about something and you think about it and you think about ways to deal with it then that sort of like gives you some like positive reinforcement that like oh I should think more about these things which makes me angstish I should think more about these stressors and I think that can almost become a compulsion where it's like you start obsessing and you just start like staying in your own head like to a point that becomes like negative and maladaptive and again like because like you have these like positive examples too because it's been like reinforced so much like it becomes like second nature and again like you you stop seeing it as a choice and I think like especially like if you start doing it like as a child it's like that almost becomes so core to your sense of self that it becomes something that you like don't even question right like I've been like like I feel like I think I think like I've been thinking like this since literally like some of my first memories so it's like there was never even really an understanding that like there was another option like I was saying like it would feel wrong almost like it would almost make me uncomfortable to not be in my head sometimes like and like I remember even like I would tell like I would be like oh like I would literally tell people sometimes like oh I don't really like enjoy like being relaxed like that or like being at peace like I really enjoy like being mentally engaged and it's not that that isn't true like I did get a lot of joy out of that I still do but at the same time like that it like it was because it made me so uncomfortable like not and like yeah like I said like I've just been realizing more and more like how much I need that and like how like toxic some aspects of that work I didn't think you were just going to agree with me I know I know I know honestly I wouldn't have thought I wouldn't have thought either you know like I feel like it's like especially with something like this where it's like it's all till it takes place in your own head right like it's like yeah it's like it's not even something you really talk about right like like how like it it feels so like I don't even know how to describe it like it feels like so like almost like scary because it's like you don't like you never know like you you almost like by definition can't know like if other people feel that way and it's like yeah it's just like yeah like you don't really you can't ever like recognize it in other people you can't ever like like see that like oh this is a normal thing that other people struggle with and like that makes you feel more alienated right that makes you feel like more uncomfortable around other people because you feel like there's all these aspects to yourself that like I don't know that just feels so like strange and so it can be hard to like open up about that I don't know yeah this kind of embarrassing to say but like I feel like for the longest time I didn't think it was a question mark in my head whether a people around me were where other people in the world were as conscious as I was I wasn't sure yeah for the longest time and that I'm not even gonna say until when because it's very embarrassing too woke bruh huh too woke too woke but yeah continue saying but it's just I just wasn't sure and I didn't know how to yeah even challenge it really yeah yeah I feel like that that's almost what keeps us so isolated right that this kind of belief that our experiences special in some way yeah yeah where it is special but it's not not not special in that it's not exclusively especially yeah yeah it's like you're saying right it's like there are things which are so like obviously like things that are unique to all of us but at the same time it's like you need understanding from other people right you need to be able to like yeah like relate like find those connections with other people too and it can be very isolating like especially with something like this it's almost like by definition like private like in your own head like how do you how do you begin to like like how do you begin to feel that level of like connection with someone else right how do you how do you trust that someone else like has the same thoughts and like feels the same way when this is all happening internally and I mean I've talked to other people who have said like exactly what you're saying where it's like they don't like they have the same feeling that like oh are there people like as like software as I am like I think for me it was slightly different it was a feeling like oh like other people like don't think as much as I do and like you know like low-key thinking other people are stupid but uh yeah like I know what you're saying like it's so like dumb to say in retrospect and it's almost like makes me feel kind of shitty but that like I thought that way you know like there's like guilt in there too but like at the same time like again like I need to be compassionate to myself like I understand where it's coming from like it's not like it's hard to recognize and like especially if you don't feel confident in yourself like you don't have security and like yourself worth like it's scary to like be vulnerable about these things and be open right about like like just how it feels like to be you and and that I think a lot of people who go through this they when they do find someone that you know that yeah they can convince themselves that this person is equally as yeah alive as I am you know when they do find that person it's yeah it's then losing that person is very very difficult yeah because now it's like oh I'm on my own again I'm on my own again yeah and this yeah and I don't and that was so crazy it was so rare I don't know if I'm gonna yeah feel like that again yeah that that connection yeah yeah so no it's not teasing yeah yeah yeah like this is something I get I guess like I want to touch on a little bit by I must feel like a lot of like for especially for like men a lot of times like they sort of like rely on like girlfriends or like partners for like emotional like security and stuff because like it's difficult to talk about like especially between like friends right like this these aren't like necessarily like normal like regular conversations that we have so it's like that's the only person that a lot of like men feel comfortable like being open emotionally with so it can be hard for them to like like they can yeah they get I don't know there's like an aspect there to unpack but yeah I'm not 100% sure what I have to say about it you know but I think it's true I mean it's like it turns into this me and you versus the world yeah the situation right and yeah I definitely felt that night and that's why like that's why when and for a lot of time when that kind of relationship ends it's very it's especially hard because it's breaking all their their whole framework about the world yeah it's not just a relationship that's us it's the entire way you interact with life yeah complete question mark now yeah yeah like any sort of emotional support network yeah so yeah it is yeah it does play a part I think that's also why some dudes are like it's almost like they feel like they need to have a girlfriend to like fix them because it's like when it's like in reality like you should be able to rely on your friends right like that's not that's like a very like like that's like a toxic thing to like put on someone else that like in reality like we should all be supporting each other right yeah it's not it's not anyone's job yeah yeah fix you and it's not your job to fix yeah yeah but I mean you know as you're growing I guess one of the roles of relationships is yeah helping each other grow and if you need that then maybe you got that and maybe oh yeah 100% the absence and when you got you grew from that and then and then and then when it was gone you learned from that perhaps more than you when you had that support yeah anything you wanted to talk about like relate to this anything honestly this has been like one of the biggest things on my mind over like the last few just like weeks like as I've been like yeah just as I've been processing everything like I've been like meditating a lot like I've been saying like getting into trying to like get in touch like with that like side of myself that isn't just like my thoughts like those experiences like I always joke with Asha that I'm entering my non-cognitive era because I'm trying not to think I'm just trying to do things which like get me out of my head but yeah that I feel like we really went over everything to be honest like I feel like this should look you be at so an episode yeah um wait you see it guys people listening like this is why our episodes take so long yeah you're getting all this stuff in real time yeah yeah it takes time yeah to let it marinate you have to really work through it before yeah um you can even get to a place where it makes sense to talk about it in a cohesive coherent way yeah and I think that's also like something I want to emphasize which is like there's nothing like again like very related to like the perfectionist stuff that we're saying I always get frustrated with how long I'm taking to like grow when it's like that's just these things take time you know you need to like give yourself like the time to mature the time to like understand how you're feeling and like let them let those feelings marinate to a point like where like you can get something productive out of the process and like you can't rush something like that like all that's gonna do is like make it harder to like get to a plate like get to where you want to be emotionally if you want to grow if you're trying to grow and you find yourself frustrated it's important to realize that you're literally trying to be someone you have never been before yeah unique patience yeah give yourself time it takes time yeah yeah but it will come and the more you hyperfixate on it you know because yeah I get I get anxious I'm like why am I I get stressed out yeah yeah it's still a problem yeah 100% yeah to realize you've never you haven't figured it out yet so it's it's gonna take time here you're on the right path yeah and like we're saying I think fundamentally it's about being compassionate towards yourself like like like that frustration comes out of I feel like this feeling of like like bitterness towards yourself oh like why aren't I already that person when it's again like that's not like that's not something that like that's not something any of us like control right like and like all that all that like bitterness and frustration will do is like make it harder to like be in touch with who you really are and like harder to be in touch with yourself and I feel like a certain level you have to extend all this stuff that you learn to other people too because yeah I don't know I can't tell you how many times I've like heard someone be like oh he's just a bad person oh yeah he's a bad person you know like and then just like completely brush him off yeah where it's like you and I'm not saying this to like justify anything but or anything anyone did everyone it should be held accountable but at the same time it's like really understanding like nobody hurts people in isolation yeah right it's like there's a whole story there's a whole there's a whole there's a whole that person is spent their whole life getting to that point yeah and it's shaped by so many things that have happened to them yeah right um their childhood their early friendships they're just everything everything and so being empathetic and giving not giving people the benefit of the doubt but giving people the chance to be someone that they're not currently right and I'm not saying you have to be friends with someone who's done you wrong yeah but because it's very important to draw your own boundaries and and yeah and you need that space recognizing when you need space from some people and taking it right yeah um but also just also also giving them the chance to grow into something yeah someone something better and a lot of people don't ever but they all have the capability to and so they're taking steps and that's that's a good sign yeah you're not you'll never be able to be empathetic towards yourself if you don't give other people the same empathy right I mean even like I was saying like on a the Kendrick album Mr. Morrell like that's a huge thing he talks about there is having empathy for all of these evil people who have done so much so much wrong but at the same time it's like that like you're saying that doesn't come out of nowhere like that's always like and I think like like that's always fundamentally out of like some sort of like pain and that doesn't justify anything that doesn't make it right but at the same time like if like like you'll never be able to give yourself understanding unless you give other people understanding and I like like I've genuinely been coming to a point where like and this is like a holotopic like this is a whole episode and it's own but I really think that sort of judgment like the sort of like moral judgment that people put on other people like is that the core of like so much human suffering and like so much like even like evil and I think like being able to being able to lend other people kindness compassion and understanding that like again that they don't deserve like yeah that I mean it's like not about deserving you know like it's not about like yeah it's not about that it's about like being able to be compassionate and to feel for other people so we can also become passionate towards ourselves because I mean we've all done like bad things right we've all hurt people we've all done evil things it's just a matter of degrees and if you just cast someone out like for those things without understanding them like how can you ever like truly come to terms with yourself and the things that you've done right yeah and you put here people on tears exactly these people are better than I look up to them these people are beneath me they're the they're the scum of the earth yeah I can't tell you how many conversations have heard like this yeah and it breaks my heart a little bit yeah 100 percent oh boy yeah you think Drake has empathy or Kendrick has empathy for Drake yeah I think he does I think like there's like so actually there's actually so much to talk there about like mr. Moral and its relationship to the whole beef because like one of the best stakes I heard was essentially like Kendrick what Kendrick is doing during the beef is essentially trying to like get the ideas he has on mr. Moral like out to the public where like he's like talks a lot about like the cycles of abuse and pain and like especially in like the black community and he's almost like using Drake as like a symbol of like this sort of like toxic like this toxic cycle like repeating itself like like like sacrificing Drake for for the public benefit yeah because like that's literally what he says on like meet the greyhums he's like we have to raise our children when there's people like him like going around like there's predators like him looking and he like literally says on that song like this is exactly what I was trying to bet on mr. Moral I maybe I need to go get that album yeah yeah I feel like I'm unlocking the album bro as I mature myself it's crazy
