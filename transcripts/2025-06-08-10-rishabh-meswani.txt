 In response to this is that, oh yeah, we're going to defeat these insertion groups. Like we talked about this, only one insertion group. Other insertion groups are terrorists. We solve for ISIS and thus we witness today and we don't cause anti-wastings sentiment that causes the car wreck and creates a positive feedback to cause more terrorism at first place. When we look at the three big issues that I talked about at the very beginning, we show you that we better solve for ISIS. We better solve for killing these insertion groups that are harmful to the society or there. We help to analyze these, we help to deal with the mass of power and mass of crisis between Syrian refugees and we actually go and help NATO and Russia in helping with which share intelligence and share air force. And for those reasons, I strongly urge and forever to thank you. I was just watching the game man, holy shit, so sad. We lost at the end. Yeah, I think they're very close game and it looked like they messed up in the last quarter. They did mess up in the last quarter. Yeah, it's just, it's cool to like, I don't know, I was thinking about like how like the emotion that comes with playoffs and everything like that. I feel that I feel that a bit more now than I used to. I mean, I used to care, but I feel like now I understand why I care a bit more. All these storylines, you know, all these people working really hard and right, there's so much chemistry dynamics between people and managers and league and drama and there's just so much that goes into it. I've come to like, appreciate that a bit more. Totally get that. Yeah, I mean, I feel the same about cricket and swimming, two sports I think I follow the most, especially cricket and sometimes they get so invested into it, it affects my day, you know, team loses. But I'm like, why does it affect me? You know, it's a team and life moves on and you know, I felt like I'm playing for this team or they even know who I am. So why should it bother me? But for some reason it does, you know, so. Yeah, it's also like kind of like a ego thing, right? It's like, it's not me. Like I'm not playing the fucking game. Like I have my own damn life to live. Like why should this affect anything in me, right? I don't know. I feel like a lot of people that watch sports all day on weekends, you know, every weekend. Sometimes like I judge them like bro, like outside, you know, live your own life. Actually touch your ass. Yeah, I guess man, like I guess there's a balance, but it is cool. Like I do understand where it comes from. If people didn't care, then the sport would be a big deal. You need you need something to believe it, you know, you need something to be passionate about. That's true. I mean, that's literally what's happening though is you're identifying with the team. That's why that's where like all of the emotional reaction comes from. And that's why it almost feels like something's personally happened to you and your team loses. If it's like a, if it's a sport like cricket where the country matters a lot, then you might get into the country. Oh, if it's like, you know, I don't know, basketball, the Warriors, if you're from the Barrier or like, you know, Lakers LA, whatever. But there's also like people who will care about teams that they have no regional affiliation with, right? Like they've on for soccer, like I'm forgetting which team you support. But technically you don't have any regional affiliation with it. No, yeah, nothing. It's like, what is it? It's like a vibe. It's like a you identify with maybe the culture, the values of the fucking the org or the player. The way it's run, you know, the players, maybe you have a favorite color. If it's like this team is literally anything. Yeah, like my favorite color is red. So I'm going to support fucking our son. But then it grows from there. And I don't know. I feel like we need, we need more literature on this. They do. I'm getting more strong. You know, Steve just lost. He's lost. I'm fine. We have. It's not over yet. They have a chance to do one, but they have to win this playoff round to wait. Yeah. So now they need to win three games straight, which is really hard. But it's possible. It's not, yeah, it's not impossible. It's happened before. It's happened before. Yeah, exactly. There you go. Entire episode is going to be grieving. I know. Me no. In 2023, it went to the cricket World Cup in India. Right? Me and my dad went to three games in India lost in the final. They were like, I'm sure they want to know about that final. And you may have watched part of it too. And I feel like the whole country was so sad. I feel like I was so unproductive from a month I was like, man, I've had so much financial and emotional energy on this world cup. And then I'm just so close they were the best team easily. And then they lost in the last game. So I say I grieved more than any other in any other part of my life in coming to sports obviously that one month for sure And it was all over social media too. Call it or to say Have you been following this crazy story about how they deported this guy with the real Madrid? No, that shit is so insane So crazy Not only did they support the guy accidentally They they acknowledge that yeah, it was accidental and then they refused to do anything to bring him back Which is so terrifying It's insane. They's just like yeah, you know what it happened, but we can't save everyone, you know Bro literally got kidnapped by the government So the governor of the state where this guy was living in he's a family there by the way. He's like a wife and kid Yeah, the governor of that state goes to El Salvador and he's like hey, we need proof that this man is alive like what the hell is going on We need you guys to release this man and he stays there for like two or three days and El Salvador is just like no And so he refuses to leave Eventually, I don't know how like maybe they'll play pressure somehow By the way the Supreme Court in this time has ruled that you have to bring him back and even after that He's like no, we're not doing anything about it And people are arguing that no, he's actually a terrorist man without any facts at all Which is insane insane you're up, but this guy eventually gets a meat And there's pictures that he actually meets with this man when he does that he announces that hey I have met this man. He is alive. I won't be making no further comments until I'm back in the US Because he's scared if he says anything like you're in El Salvador who that knows what's gonna happen to him and El Salvador Just take the senator down Salvador So all these news reports they report this and then there's a brief wait for a day Until he gets back and then the next day we get the report that oh this guy has been not treated well and present Like it's really like I forget the exact details But they're talking about like how vile the living conditions are and all that stuff This is not like funny to me though because it's so fucking scary the government can let you just kidnap you send you to an El Salvador Jail with like violent gang members be like yeah, that was our bad bro But we're not gonna do anything to help you and just fucking leave you to rot there All right, so I guess to kick things off I'd just like to introduce our guests the one and only Rishabe Misswani Rishabe is the founder of Fremont debate academy a non-profit which has stretched out far past Fremont at this point And is focused on providing debate and civics programs around the globe for students FDA has worked in across eight different countries at this point and more than 15 states I mean, it's just an amazing project that's doing great work around the globe speaking more personally though me and Rishabe have been frenemies since high school We both room together during college as well. Yeah, I love this man and It's been just crazy seeing this all grow I still remember the initial seeds of this idea when it was just the small thing in Fremont And it's been crazy to see just how it's developed over time and to see your personal development over the years Let me too, man So glad you're here bro. I will say like Rishabe is one of the quirkiest people I've ever met He's so different. It's actually insane. He doesn't care about music, which is insane to me But what are some other facts I hear like let's let's roll that oh god where do I even start the beans bro The beans yes the beans he's he has a weird obsession with beans and toast and not just like Nobody ever believes me when I tell the facts about the sorts of beans and toasts as many But he just takes beans straight from the can and pours them on to bread and jimble just to eat it I remember I was telling one of my friends from high school car think about this And he thought I was for sure exaggerating until you walked into my apartment door Look to the left at our kitchen and saw this man mid-poor It was a very efficient meal in college man got the calories in Yesterday Devam sent in the group chat immediately and read and I got really excited I thought that was being read and I thought the legacy is you know living on and But I was disappointed I'm so realizing what I think this is I think this is one legacy that will die with you and the British right? Yeah, they still like doing that so Yeah, it'll be good to colonize Ten and millions of people and also crazy fact is I have never seen Rishoban shorts to this day I wish that day will come soon. I dream about it sometimes actually wow. I will consider it man funnily enough I swam for so many years so I definitely wore but I've never seen the shorts for a long time I've never yeah, I barely wear shorts always wear like a deedous joggers or jeans Oh the joggers are way very handful amount of times over the past like eight ten years that we've known each other Yeah, to be fair we covered a lot of doubt that we make fun of you about but outside of all that Like outside of all that Rishob is one of the funny. Yes, not on purpose I feel like involuntarily funny inadvertently inadvertently funny, but also like One of the most driven one of the most passionate people carrying and there's so many adjectives I'll take it. I appreciate it. Don't know so anyway, and then that's so we're excited to have you on pick your brain a little bit and Have some cool conversations. That's good man looking forward to it. I've been following you all for a while now It's been like one one more one of the year now and so honored to be on here finally All right, boys. What's going on? Let's let's hear it. I am turning 26 this week, which means that I can't use my parents in shorts anymore, which is kind of wild I realized that like you're getting old and so yeah, is that stressing you out? Little bit, you know, I have to like get my own insurance for the first time. It's like it's a process, you know Right. I feel like I understand insurance a little bit, but now I actually have to like get into the weeds a bit Yeah, kind of a kind of a crazy thing. What about you all lazy Sunday? I honestly just slept in I woke up at like 12 or something I wasn't feeling too hot yesterday So I was just getting some rest. How about you? They I'm good man. I'm good. It's been really nice weather out here So just been like being out more like yesterday I went out and like kicked a ball around with a friend. That was amazing He came back and and it started raining really hard, but it was like warm Yeah, it was amazing whether I was just like blasting music having a good time I just feel like I'm at a point where like there's multiple things that I'm able to like pull joy from Just set up around me and so like it's cool like it's just it allows me to like live in flow a little bit more It's cool to see like all that work that you put into building your life start to like pay off help you get unstuck and like move along Yeah, so yeah, it's that's cool It's like the crazy thing about all this is you put in all this work all this reflection all this setup processing Whatever you need to do to like get to this point and then you're at this point and it's like oh, I feel happy Great, but then then it's like oh should I what should I do should I analyze this should I sit with this like what am I like Should I figure out what is working then you have to remember like no the whole point is to just experience it and just Yeah, just sit with that and It's the thing about being present right the moment you start thinking about being present. You're not present anymore So that's like yeah Yeah, it's I believe it's what they call Dow in Chinese, but yeah, we're not gonna get it to that Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, we're so used to thinking about what's next that it's hard to just like remember that being happy is like It's fun being happy At least for a bit. Yeah, I definitely had those moments where I'm like present and then I start analyzing the fact that I'm present I start getting stressed about the fact that I'm analyzing it and I'm like you need to stop But then I can't Yeah, literally I can just imagine you're here thinking about it because here's one of the more Philosophical people I've been friends with like even throughout college and even high school I always thinking about philosophical frameworks and like how to think about things and I feel like I don't I don't think that deep enough And then like here's always just thinking about things and I'm like maybe I'm not thinking about it enough So I can see like you're happy and you're just like let's analyze why I'm happy You know what makes me happy These are jokes. This is a cry for help No, I get it's a it's a blessing in disguise, but it can also have it's called yes. Yeah, how do you feel? What what what goes through your head when you're happy? Are you just happy or you think about why you're happy? Yeah, I probably Analyze your happiness now for us I'm probably like you to it away too like I'll be happy for a bit But then I'm like all right, what's next? How can I continue this happiness? How can I continue this momentum? But then again, I gotta be in the present. So it's it's important. I get you I get you you know, you know what I like bro Like I got this blanket here. This is a blanket that you bring you know It has brought me so much joy Like I don't think you understand. I used to wake up hot So at night when I go to sleep, I want my blanket to be big and cozy and warm and heavy, yeah But when I wake up, I'm always burning hot This sounds like an infomercial So I look this up and everyone's like you need to buy an Australian marino wool blanket and put a duvet cover on it Bamboo sheets are some kind of nice duvet cover on taking notes for an hour And so that's what I did I bought myself an Australian marino wool blanket. It has changed my life It's like bright amount of weight. It's breathable. It's warm. It can be 75 degrees 80 degrees And I'll wake up and I'm not burning hot And I'll like wake up there will be a smile on my face a big wow I feel good You have to you have to make my family achieve happiness This is what I needed in my life to be happy Oh time Maybe if I had this blanket all along this podcast wouldn't have happened I wouldn't have had depression Yeah exactly That's a very high ROI purchase You guys you guys have to make that your sponsor No first we need to partner with FDA That's the first Of course Yes We can give each other free publicity Perfect Yes always welcome So let's start with FDA Yeah like I have some questions about Free month debate Academy not the food and drug administration Okay So this is an org you started maybe like 10 over 10 years ago now right at this point very briefly like aim is to motivate kids to pursue debate Competition communication like all those things and you've grown it so much like across school districts What does it mean to you like I feel like starting something like that building it putting in all that work is such a crazy Insane process like what is what does FDA mean to you and why have you done this All the top of everything you know on top of college on top of graduating And then you work as a data scientist that's not easy. Yeah Yeah, no, it's it's kind of my baby, you know, I feel like I can't even think about a life without the organization now It's just been so long Maybe I can talk a little bit about kind of like why we started it way back in the day And then kind of like what the motivations are now I had done debate in middle school starting in seventh grade And it was done at Warner or middle school that here and I went to and we had a teacher there that Miss came who actually taught us debate and you know We want to torn them in and all of that and I was really really into it and then went to high school and did debate over there You know here was in debate as I think the everyone was in debate for a bit as well Middle brief Yeah, no, no, you're good. I'm character and in intent grade I was still helping out with the middle school debate team and had the realization that like hey we could like you know Spread this to more schools like no elementary schools have a debate program You know one to other middle schools don't have a debate program You can do something with this and so I had a friend Kirtana who actually is good friends with all of us her dad I had been volunteering at Harvey Green Elementary the local elementary school that my sister went to and We mean him we're talking about how maybe we could create like a debate program at Harvey Green Elementary School And so we started it and I actually kind of got three other co-founders Ratchet William Basemond who were in Warner debate and Irvington debate with me and I was good friends with them And I was like no let's start this you know at that time I don't know anything we called it for my debate academy just yet or we just had started in the middle or something like that And then we went and kind of created a program for 30 students and it was it was a lot of fun parents loved it kids loved it we really enjoyed it We got a great volunteer team and the next year we were like let's start it at new schools And we started a few more schools and then it kind of grew from there And now obviously it's a much larger organization Our approach has changed our strategy has changed and what we're doing has changed a little bit as well But that was kind of the motivation honestly that we just thought it would be cool to teach debate to younger students And we saw the impact that debate had on us in terms of you know the ability to help us become better public speakers Leaders you know critical thinkers thinking about the world Knowing more about the world thinking how to research thinking about how to you know argue respectfully It disagree with one each other respectfully and how to teach Others that I think would be good for the kids even if they don't pursue debate like later on That that wasn't really then cool And so yeah, that's kind of what motivated us to start it back in late 2014 And now I think honestly like I said like it's kind of my baby You know, I can't imagine a world without it and it's just so so cool to see a bunch of the kids that we teach how they've grown So many of the elementary school kids that I taught now like you know became like champion debaters They became leaders they're doing such amazing things building nonprofits of their own that I kind of help Advise them on you go ahead and to great colleges get great jobs all those things and like really making it impacting society in their own way And I feel like what they found through FDA and over the years doing the programs And eventually becoming leaders in the nonprofit themselves even after there were students and many of them do I feel like played a small part of that um and that keeps me going So just kind of seeing that impact and seeing how much parents and kids and community Numbers and stakeholders appreciate it and just you know going and visiting the program every week and just seeing all the work hard work Hey off it never gets old so yeah, that's cool man. I feel like it's so important I don't know. It's just builds confidence right like more than anything It's just like if you have a thought about something How do you form it into a proper sentence right? phrase and then and then the confidence to raise your hand not raise your hand just speak it out loud to other people That I feel like kind of frees you yeah, no absolutely. It's hard to have confidence in yourself If you can't express yourself right and who you are so that's such a foundational skill Yeah, yeah, and it's not just like debate that can do this I think a lot of other Mediums can do this but debate I think for sure can I think it's like proven statistically and like so many great outcomes And all the studies that have been done on it but I think more than all of that which I think is all really important It's what I said earlier. I think over the past couple of years has made me realize is that I think debate can teach you how to Respectfully disagree with each other and I think it's really important in this like polarized world We live in you know, we're all even us three on this call like We all have heated conversations over together about random things that happen But we all like really respectfully we do it, you know Um, and we like get where each other are coming from and I think debate gives you a framework on how to think about that How to not let your biases and like emotions creep in which it does for all of us Uh inevitably, but minimize that and just you know have logical points see where each other is coming from It's like I think more important than ever That is something that I think we think of as one of the biggest impacts not so much about how they do in competition or any of that That's like a byproduct and if it goes well as well, but I think that this is this is one of the point of the big thing Honestly, like I feel like just as important as it is to like know how to like express yourself and dish it out and all that stuff Also, it teaches you like if you're wrong about something if you haven't considered a point that someone else is making and maybe you're getting your motions are getting the way it teaches you to accept that with grace and it's like okay You know what? Yeah, you are you do have a point there maybe I haven't thought about this like whatever that skill is even more important because people don't know how to listen like that Sometimes people learn how to talk, but they don't know how to listen that's like No, no, 100% we all do that right we all we all like letter emotions take over But it's really important like you said they've come to like accept that I think that also is something a debate can teach you and teaches you really quickly because When you're in debate rounds right oftentimes what happens is that actually all the times you go to tournament for example Or you go to like a practice round and FDA program you're given aside That's the topic is you want to increase the minimum wage you're given aside You don't you don't get to choose what side you're given aside and you have to debate for things that or supporting something that you might not even believe it And that actually teaches you how to understand other side, you know Actually ironically though on the other hand debaters are also known not to be the best listeners Because sometimes they can get so passionate about it And so that's like something that we really try to instill it got to listen you got to you got to you know Make sure that you're you're writing things down taking your time to think and then think about a refutation or just like You don't understand where they're coming from and the best way you can do that is research beforehand So you kind of understand where they're coming from that makes you a better debater, but also makes you a better listener and people want to talk to you about things then And it's not just oh yeah, I'm gonna go talk this person is gonna be like a big battle And then if that happens no one's learning anything out of it, so right I guess there is a balance there where it's like some people get so Suspicious about just winning the argument Okay, bro, like I'm also making a valid point just accept Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm competition, right. Yes. Yes. No, that's fair. That's fair But but but this skill is important man This this is turning into like a fucking like how I built this podcast bro with the Oh I like that you guys listen to that right like I know Rich have you definitely do I definitely did yeah Definitely did I haven't listened to it very recently, but it's such a great Yeah, I said that guy guy Ross. He's just just such a great voice Just like you two feel like you guys can you guys are getting there, you know, that's sweet Maybe one day you know, like I feel like maybe we start was this whole thing ever just like a ploy to get into a good You know, like most things like okay nowadays every kid has a Calling him out for this bro, especially in high school And it's not a bad thing. It's the world you live in you have to stand out in some way And maybe in the process you make some impact and I think that's a good thing honestly Do inevitably I'm just wondering if it was ever like that for you guys and for you personally And if it was like maybe it changed along the way like what happened yeah, yeah for sure That's a really good question And it's kind of funny seeing all the nonprofits now and so many of them It's like created by many of our students or like we actually help them like they asked us like how do you create a nonprofit? How do we do this? And so it is kind of funny, but I think you nailed it. They're from in that like it's not a bad thing And then it's it's kind of become me missionally, but on the same hand like they're still making an impact right regardless of Extrinsic motivation was but yeah on on our motivation. I mean, I think I don't think I had the initial idea or built it because of College ups. I think like I was just really passionate about it and I just really enjoyed leadership bringing people together Making an impact then some volunteering at that school anyways Uh, and I thought it was like it was really good. I was really fun And it was it was fun to do with the group people that I enjoyed working with But I can't say that like at some point in the process in the first like year 10 to 11 12th grade I would think like hey one added benefit is that it's gonna look good for college apps And you got to have multiple extrinsic motivations and anything you do if I'm enjoying the process and making an impact and you know Learning a lot and also it helps your college apps. Well, yeah, it's pretty good Yeah, but I don't think it was a sole purpose because if it was then I probably wouldn't be still doing it Because I don't really have any more apps to write anymore. So Yeah, well, yeah, of course I mean the base the like you said like the base motivation was you're enjoying the process I mean once that's there then everything else is just a cherry on top right exactly exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, you actually started it for the cloud No, that's good. That's key. I feel like what happens is a lot of people don't learn how to do that And I know we've like you're talking about this in every episode somehow But it's like yeah, do shit because you like doing it not because it'll look good on a fucking app Or whatever it may be if you're not trying to get brownie points like it's a way yeah Like it's not a game like life isn't a game where you're just trying to achieve like the highest number of points You know karma or how farming you know to stop or Am I to use the term or a farming? No, I just learned about the term and it's so good bro Yeah Okay, then you're definitely too old to use or a farming It's like or a farming is a 2024 2025 day, right? It's not that old. Yeah. Amen times change fast if you If you just learned about it in the last few weeks like no you're behind Hey, man, you're gonna stay on the meta, you know like have you have y'all heard of the Italian brain rock animals Like are you all on this wave? I know I'm not You all haven't heard of bumper dealo crocodile and trallo lello trallo law And And I'm gonna change your life these are all AI generated animals that have become famous. They're not animals. They're like They're like animal They're like I don't even know they're they're not animals. They're like animal slash sting hybrids which And people there's so much lore around them. It's insane like bumper deal or crocodile actually has roots and like On the air strikes in Palestine and Yeah, it's there's so much lore about each of these like we could do at whole episode Yeah, but I actually want to know how do you know about this It's my algorithm that I've built brick by brick. Okay. I put in a lot of work into it. Okay It's this is this is all the work that I was talking about earlier when we started that episode like this is the setup that I've done with my life This is my life just enjoy it. Yeah, deep and do read it and Twitter. No, this is all I This is not ready ready to say For red is not where the kids are anymore I'm gonna be out of touch for suggesting reddit bro Yeah, there's these memes that are like people born between 92 and 99 they're like married having kids like going on vacation Everyone between 99 and 2008 or 2005 or whatever is like These Italian brain rot animals And 2005 onwards everyone's like in couples again and like in relationships, you know Wow, I hope the Italian brain rot animals will pass soon. It's not something that I'm particularly proud of I was just meaning it already has a Wikipedia page which is a real big Out of date we are bruh So he wasn't making it up wow you thought I just made all that shit up bro. What kind of imagine This guy's not that good at improv Dude, he's actually very creative. You know, I never know. Wow, I do want to do improv I feel like that would that would be that's a good skill to have Fuck debate. I feel like people should do more in pro Hey debate he did that problem bro It's a problem for four years Yeah, yeah, um wait this Wikipedia page was created on April 20th from what I can see so it is That's before the episode This is what is doing on 420. I was just writing He's actually yeah someone must have it. We got so high I don't know Anyways guys, let's go back to the conversation. Yeah, why people are listening to us and not this bullshit I know how much work it is to like start something. I've experienced a little bit of that You know, I did the whole c.w.c. I see thing bitch by the way guys like Bishop is the reason I started c.w.c. and I use c.w.c. and I use c.w.c. If you don't know like c.w.c. is a consulting club that I started with a few friends in In college and we were like working with small businesses. It was a great time But that was a lot of work man And I feel like you put in you've put in way more work than I put in into c.w.c. and it's like I don't know about that No, no, no, it's 100% true like I see you working on your org all the times like sometimes skipping things You know like social things sometimes obviously it comes from something intrinsic you kind of touched on this Must be something really gratifying about it and it's really cool to like have something that you're so passionate about right Like I've always been fascinated and annoyed at you for skipping Singing out with me sometimes and jealous of this thing But like what is that like I'm sure you have some back and forth going on in your head about it But what is that like it's so it's cool that I feel like you can care about something so deeply. Yeah Yeah, no, no for sure You nailed it on the head like there been many times where I had to sacrifice things socially Haven't hung out with friends haven't gone on trips. You know Haven't done like random impromptu things because I have a meeting for FDA I'll have something I need to work on or like because I'm working on FDA It also means that like I also have to balance work with that um So so it's tough and you know I'm like learning how to balance it more and more But it's just like I want to make sure that the organization as well and Sometimes because it's an organization that which like no one's getting paid right now or you know It's all volunteer based we have a large team, but it's all volunteer based It also means that like you know me and the rest of the founders like we have to we have to pull through when others may not be able to right when like others have Some other things going on in life or or like relying on someone or some stakeholder get something done But then they can't because of some x situation which makes total sense right no one's paying them for it And so we have to pull through which means that it's hard to do things in promp to but we're working on it We're working on potentially hiring someone potentially scaling things up so that we can still be really involved But we can choose when to be involved and play a bit more of a visionary role rather than being so involved day to day I think we've been getting there slowly but shortly and it's a process that I think will take you know at least a year or two more to kind of fully figure out But when we get there will be kind of best of book rules where we'll be able to still contribute to the organization still play a visionary role still We still do everything that we love about it But kind of step away from day to day and and that's kind of what we're going for that That's what I have to remind myself like in the meantime I'm gonna have to make sacrifices in the long run I think you'll all be worth it. I'll have a better balance in life So yeah, yeah, that's that's what goes on my mind when these things happen I guess that's cool I mean obviously like throwing money at the problem will solve the problem sometimes and in this case it definitely will Yes But like what's interesting is like how you got to this point where you are the head of the org right the three other people that you have But then you have other people that are you know supposed to do things sometimes they can't pull through that means you have to do it Right, yes, that's just how it is Exactly And I mean at the heart of it it comes down to like people care about things to different degrees right like you can be Involved in something like FDA, but maybe you can't give up your weekends to work on it, right? Like maybe you can only give a few hours a week whatever. Yeah, I feel like I I used to get very not used to I keep saying used to no I get sometimes I get very like frustrated right? It's almost like if I care about something and someone else is supposed to do something and maybe they don't pull through I get frustrated. I get petty. I get like Why are you not doing the thing right? It makes me wonder like why am I doing something? Why am I putting in so much like why do I care about this is like What is wrong here? Right? There's some kind of dissonance there And I think part of it comes from a lack of clarity on like why you care about it But I don't know curious to hear your thoughts on that. Yeah. Yeah. No, for sure No, that's something that is it's really important. I was not very good at thinking about that in the early years at least Right, I would be like I'm putting all this effort. There's so many others in the organization You know, they're really passionate about it. I know they've committed to something Why do they not pull through or why did they not pull through in this instance? And then you start thinking about like they get the same credit for as I do maybe but like they didn't put the same amount of effort And then I realized like in the end it's my organization And so I don't like there's no point thinking about credit not credit And I think I realized this over the past five years It's really about like what makes sense for the organization But I think I think more importantly something I realized is that especially in non-profit setting where we're all doing this in a volunteer basis at least It's really important to set expectations and communicate with the people you're working with Whether that's like my co-founders or you know large team We have a team of like over 200 volunteers many of them are leadership roles many of them are more just volunteers Putting in 10-15 hours whatever the number is more over a course of a school year It's really important to set expectations and make sure to communicate where they are with things with organization What is a time level? What is the time coming midday can put in what can we expect from them in terms of how quickly are to respond What type of things they can work on and that way there's no feeling of guilt on any one side Like hey if they have set expectations that look today or this next couple of months I'm really busy. There's other things going on in my life Right some other situation in my life going on with work or family whatever it is I'm not going to be able to put in the same amount of time. I did the past few months We know that right And so we ask everyone to always communicate and make sure that happens Because otherwise then you go meet that person for some other thing that's going on And then the inevitably they're gonna feel guilty and be like oh yeah Sorry about that one thing I didn't do or sorry about like you know I haven't been responding well for the last couple weeks And I don't want that like I really that's that's happened in the past And I really don't like that and so I think we just ask everyone to communicate it's really important to check in Really important to set the right expectations so that there aren't any weird feelings like that Now honestly, I think that's been a big leadership learning for me over the past 10-11 years I've been doing this like First five years for six years like I probably didn't do it as well But over the time I kind of learned that like hey it's important to be able to do that process And that's made me a lot more content like if I'm putting more work disproportionately than someone else I expect to put in the equal minor work that's fine because we've talked about it And there may be another time where it's out the way around and they'll be fine with the two because we've talked about it and stuff like that So that makes sense if communication Super important. Yeah, that's the big one isn't it. It's just like Like yeah, like if you don't communicate and then you don't deliver it's like god damn it bro like like yeah That that's way worse because if you communicate beforehand you can figure out some solution If it's like last minute then it's like wait And you know, it's I think this situation is the most unique because if you Like you know for profit setting like we all work in tech there's like this expectation getting paid You know and you have you got to do this you know we're paying you for a reason Or even like a school project in a way it's almost kind of like you know you're getting a grade You're getting a score in a way over here and everyone's doing it because they're passionate about it There's no other reason why anyone needs to do it. I mean yes Like the volunteers and the leaders that look out on their college apps right or sub-sup like that In the end they're not getting paid for it, you know if they drop out one day probably nothing's gonna happen to them Uh right if one of the volunteers or leaders who are going to do something they drop out last minute And so you know that's why it's really important to set those right expectations Because I think it's a really unique situation the kind of setting that they were working in yeah How about you all how do you feel like you guys have changed in terms of like being able to deal with people dropping the ball You're gonna work or any of the side projects you all work on right? I think for me personally like I've just grown to have a lot more perspective on things that might be going on in other people's lives Just understanding that hey like just because I care about something so much That doesn't mean that like another person does and even if they do maybe they care about it the same or even more Yeah, there's other circumstances right in people's lives people are dealing with all kinds of stuff I've grown to like recognize that more and so I don't let myself get carried away with those emotions Like I used to but also like recognizing that yeah Like communication is important like that's the bare minimum Otherwise, it's just really hard to like work with anyone right like because you also have to look out for yourself Like you can't always make excuses for other people a part of you dies, you know every time So that having that boundary is also important the other thing is like I've always been very good at delegating things I've been always a master delegator and I know where it comes from it comes from my dad It's so crazy And I've recognized that now the problem was I turned a lot of my like personal relationships into like that where it's like We're like just delegating things like oh you do this. I'm doing that and it's like bro Like I wouldn't have their life like you can't just tell people to do something Yeah, yeah, this is like a bit tangential but every time I got close to someone I saw them as part of my inner circle or as more a part of myself And then so then I started then I would start treating them closer to how I treat myself Yeah, if that makes sense and then but for so many years how I treated myself was not good So yeah, it was just constant pushing myself not being great friend like like you know You're like yelling at myself internally like no you have to get this done you have to go do this What do you mean you're anxious? No, just go do the fucking thing like it has needs to be done You know like you're better than that like all this all this all this chatter right and so I mean I would still treat other people better than I treated myself But I realized that was why I was doing that yeah, I was very driven But there was a lack of empathy or a lack of or I was not approaching it in the right way I feel like and that affected sometimes affected my personal relationships And that's changed where I feel like I am way better about that now where I don't let that happen And honestly the only reason I can do that now is because I've worked on my inner voice so much that I just understand what that's like So it's a very beautiful self-reflection. What about you here? Oh, I mean I feel like I pretty much agree with everything you guys have been saying like I think communication is really the biggest thing When there's that emotional aspect on both sides that can make Communication and effective communication hard it could be that I'm not gonna be able to hit a deadline Or I'm not gonna be able to deliver and something I could and my own guilt and emotional response can make it difficult for me to communicate sometimes And so I feel like I've gotten much better about being open and being honest about the situation and Communicating when I have expectations for other people too and I definitely agree with what you said they want about where I'm just like a strong believer that how we treat ourselves We necessarily sort of reflect that onto the people who are close to us. Obviously. It's not one-to-one I feel the same way where I treat myself worse than the people around me But yeah pretty much just completely in agreement with you guys It's interesting because I feel like I used to have a lot more drive and I would find myself in a lot of leadership roles But I don't think I was a great leader But I feel like now I would be a way better leader But the drive is completely gone like I don't like the idea of being ahead of a org or like a CEO or something like I was startup It doesn't appeal to me anymore the same way it used to and that's been an interesting shift as well I mean, I will say you're probably giving yourself less credit than you deserve in this in the sense that I feel like CYC UCLA I was actually just in a conversation last week with someone who's like Simbling is going to UCLA or friends are going to UCLA and they were like yeah, man CYC UCLA is like it's like the biggest consulting club is one of the most popular clubs on campus and like everyone wants to get into it And I was like yeah, that was my friend who created it and and that the thing is like really grown And has a really great structure around it And so that speaks volumes about your delegation and the vision you set It's like unique because it has the healthcare consulting and all those things and so like and it doesn't feel like it's one of those other Like any other normal consulting club that's like really intense in nature anything like that people have a good time But also like you know make a good impact if something lasts for what means almost six seven years now It was probably really well done. So yeah, I do have an update for you though. Yes, have you heard the news? I don't know. I'm not sure CYC UCLA has rebranded oh No longer part of CYC Really? Okay, because and not throwing any shade disclaimer the current leadership decided that they wanted to work with you know like bigger companies for Yeah, that's that classic stuff And and so they kind of changed their own path and I feel like I understand I was young too like I mean I'm still young, but I was younger You know like the it's nice to have the check in the shiny company on your resume and the and the pool Patagonia and the nice retreat with the yacht and everything I get it. I get it It's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't blame them. I don't blame you But yeah, I mean I'm glad that it lasted as long as it did and it was a good run in that form And obviously like some things have changed on the outside, but it's still the same work. So it's cool No, it's cool. Yeah, for sure for sure No, and I think you have a very calm demeanor you know how to speak with people You know how to like talk to people make them feel good about themselves And I feel like that's what leadership's about. So I think you did that really well. I appreciate that man Yeah, so I guess pivoting back to FDA and just the trajectory and the path that you took there I definitely understand what you're saying about how you got into that and like just that passion and how that Care you through just seeing the impact and like help that you could give to all the school districts and to all of these students Who got access to like a debate program through you? How did you go from that to branching out to other states and especially other countries because I feel like That takes a level of ambition and that takes yeah like I guess like what was the thought process for you getting to that Yeah, I think to answer that probably have to go a little bit more into like the weeds of how the organization works So first couple of years it was just like how we had discussed which was we had a bunch of us high school volunteers And then you know a few of us run college, but like it's still a big high school volunteer team Just going and running programs in three months and like every year we would add a few more programs and it was going great You know and students would become volunteers and volunteers you know become leaders and all of this and then when they go into college Some of them would still help out and all of that it was great and then actually like closer to the pandemic time I think a year before the pandemic or year or two we started thinking about how we can run programs Elsewhere we had done some work in India before and in a few other places, but We started thinking about how we can do that more scaly and so we started basically finding other high schoolers That you know are quite driven in other states and such to run their own programs And we would support them with their with our curriculum with all the support logistics and somewhere to support them and kind of guide them So then we can create kind of FDH chapters across everywhere And so that's been still going on a lot of our you know programs in different states and countries that that's how it works And we have a whole outreach team and programs team that does that I think most recently past couple of years especially past five years We've been working and partnering more with districts and I think that's really changing the trajectory of the organization So what that means is that we'll work with districts to actually train a lot of their school teachers to run their own programs Either with our help some cases like locally or in other cases With the help of their kind of support system recruit volunteers and stuff like that to help run their programs We did that a lot with like Broward County in Florida With that some stuff with Hayward as well and here locally and a couple other areas I think the biggest one is actually in Fremont where past two years we've kind of had a contractor the school district They pay us an amount for us training all their teachers to run these programs And then we kind of help a lot with you know volunteer coordination you know developments of development of high school and college alumni volunteers For them to become leaders and you know they kind of in the teachers and the high schoolers run the programs together And the college people are doing a lot of the behind the scenes work as well as a lot of the high school people doing Be it the behind the scenes work and so we've kind of tried to replicate that with different districts as well We can talk about where we are with that very later on But that's kind of model we've used to kind of grow outside of Fremont if that makes sense Yeah, I do And does that do you feel like like your passion and your engagement has changed as like the character of the work changes Since you're obviously like a lot less directly involved in these like outreach programs and stuff Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I think that more passion than ever actually like you know over time the impact really accumulates right and you can see The fruits of the labor um, so to speak. I'm just uh just the other day Uh, I was at a program. It was like the last session. You have like a showcase session and we were having like the high school leads and the teacher running the program We're like passing off certificates and usually it's just like you pass out the certificates after like their showcase debates We say some closing remarks and like say what's next and then the program's done right eight week session program done But then this time around a parent came up. I've never seen this before parent came up Uh, and was like hey, I want to say something and she just talks about how both of her kids over the years have been part of the FDA program for many many years Have done many sessions and how much it's changed their lives It's been really great kind of seeing them and how great of experience they've had working with the organization and all the volunteers and leaders and the school teachers working with us And like I feel like moments like that are like wow, okay, you know, this is this really this really is awesome then I feel like the quality of our programs have also improved right and you know, we do that if put in more effort and put in more time and Putting more quality time as well and what strategic Yeah, yeah That makes it This cool man the idea of having a parent come up to you and be like what you've done has changed The trajectory of my kids lives like that's that's so cool. Yeah, it's nice to hear it's really nice to hear and honestly the parents are really great too They're so supportive they've helped us in so many ways getting the district contract or working with schools to get programs there I mean parent parents are pretty awesome. So they really want what's best for their their kids And I think they believe that a debate can really help with that. So yeah, in fact this cool man I feel like that's always kind of been at the core of like anything that I've done But that's the reason I work at the job that I do currently Like that's the reason we're doing this podcast like that's the reason You're doing FDA like I feel like that having that as a core driver is so valuable What do we yeah, I think it keeps you really fulfilled and you know if you if you can't get that from work Then you can get it from something like FDA for me personally or vice versa, right? Like and it can be also like different stages where at some point I'm doing like I feel like I'm making more impact or just feeling a lot more fulfilled from work Sometimes I can feel like I'm feeling fulfilled from FDA And that that really helps me. Yeah, I wonder if we've talked about this before But it reminds me of like the concept of eki guy Basically their belief is like what you do in life to have a fulfilling life should be like kind of at the center of Three things which is one is like it has to make an impact in the world Like it has to create some kind of value for for for the world, right? Yeah, the second one is it has to help you support yourself and your family And then the third thing is it has to give you fulfillment, right? Like you have to feel passionate about it Most people in their jobs don't get all three It's just in the society we live in it's hard to do that You have to be very very lucky to get all those three things from one thing So if you find yourself like missing that you need to create something in your life that helps you fill in all these three things Absolutely, no And I think creating those things for you is really important I've noticed in my life that when something bad happens If it's like something good follows in in short, you know, do time And it's happened a lot If you've noticed that like since probably college Like get rejected from an internship And then something will happen in FDA and like oh really excited about Or you know something happens Some some bad thing happens in FDA We we couldn't secure this partnership with some district because of some You know reason but then something great happens at work I almost kind of think about it like when we think about like a stock market We think about like never find our portfolio, right? I kind of almost think of this as like diversifying your source of happiness And what I mean by that is personally what's really helped me You know you talked about like balancing work and FDA and social life and all that Personally, what's really helped me is you know I know that work is always going to be a big part of my life I think it's a big part of all of our lives We spend probably the plurality of our waking hours thinking about work or doing work Right? Whether we like it or not, that gets true Me having the opportunity to work on something like FDA that is productive But you know it's productive in its own ways And I feel a lot of fulfillment from that Means that if things aren't going well with one fast in my life There's a good chance that just with random odds that There is going to be something good happening in another part of my life And that's always been true for me When I look at like weeks at a time if something's bad going out work Something I can find something good at FDA and feel really fulfilled and happy In vice versa if not then I can feel like something at work where I really help someone or I really built like a cool project or a cool model Or something like that and feel like it's making an impact in the organization And and for what the organization is trying to do Even if FDA is not going so well And I think that's that's been really helpful for my own kind of personal mental health And just like personal sanity as well Yeah Yeah That is cool It's like having multiple things going on at the same time Where if one thing is not is stuck or not to going well or terrible And you can like focus a lot of it is just like what you divert your energy towards right Like if you have one thing and it's going shit Your whole life is going to be yeah exactly right Like single point failure Exactly Yeah and then and and I think you can really be optimistic And if like optimism is really important Yeah I feel like you can be very optimistic if you have something to look forward to In some facet of your life But it's it's very often that like sometimes at work You just have like two bad things going to happen in a day And you're like I'm nothing to look forward to And so now I'm like hey no I mean I look forward to something really cool happening on FDA on Wednesday And vice versa And so I think just being optimistic just that keeps you happier It keeps you going And I think that that's really helped me personally Yeah But it also comes to trade-offs Which just means that like you have less time to just like chill out Right But that's that's the good way to look at it Yeah Yeah, I mean your your second thing doesn't have to be a national organization Yeah Or But it can be something smaller than that But yeah Yeah Exactly Yeah It's something chill Absolutely It can be a hobby You know you're going and playing And like you know just a great little forward to that You're like looking forward to working with your teammate Coming up with a new strategy to win the game Whatever it is you know As long as you have something else Like other things just decide where They can be a lot of the way No I definitely struggled with that There was a big period of time where like I only had work going on And I didn't really have anything else in this side And when that was bad My whole life was just like a complete mess And I mean there are many reasons for that I didn't have anything going on I didn't know how to deal with All that stuff like a pressure being Or being burnt out Like all that kinds of stuff Yeah No for sure It's like something to think about When you find yourself in that hole But the thing you have to keep in mind The thing that what I've realized also is that Make sure you don't get into the hole of thinking about Opportunity cost too much So what I mean by that is like Okay like if I put 50, 60 hours more Maybe 50 hours of work right? Okay good number I think most people work around that much If you're working in tech or something like that If I'm putting 20 hours a week on FDA I could put those 20 hours a week into work And probably get promoted faster Or you know like you know You get delivered at something faster Whatever the outcome is I work and I want But I have to be okay with Hey I cannot go all in into one thing Because there is a benefit to just going Putting as many hours on one thing as possible There is a trade-off And I have to be okay with that trade-off And we all have to be okay with that trade-off If we're going to have like hobbies And other things that we can work on Apart from work Yeah it's hard for me to sometimes accept the fact That I have to have to have make trade-offs in my life That I have like a fine amount of hours And it's just like you're saying When you know if you put in that extra time into one thing And you can almost put expectations for yourself That are unrealistic about Oh I'll just do everything like Perfectly Yeah I think it's very important to stay grounded And keep perspective on the fact that It's sort of inevitable If I'm taking up one thing Something else in a slip And that's not like an issue Or I mean that there's a problem With what I'm doing That's just Yeah life Yeah And in a way that's what keeps life interesting That's how I know you're very active with younger kids and stuff Inevitably I feel like there's going to be Like people in high school People in college listening to this We talked a lot about the benefits of debate And you know non-profit And all this stuff But I kind of wanted to touch on kind of the dark side You can disagree with me You can have your own tech But I want to bring it up A lot of kids end up doing Something like debate or Dekka or whatever Because they feel like they have to Yeah It's just like a thing they have to do And they kind of like Slogging their way through it It's like oh shit I have to do this I have to get good at debate I have to like get it on my app And they're like burning themselves out They're doing like 5 million things Maybe like they realize Okay maybe debate is cool Maybe they learned a couple things But maybe it's not for them But they're still like slogging away I just wanted to like address that It's not a one size fits all kind of deal Like not everyone has to become a leader in debate And you know excel at that kind of stuff So if you find yourself kind of in that position Like it's important to take a step back And really acknowledge where you're at And maybe you got what you needed out at this And maybe it's time for something different Yeah yeah yeah, that's a tough one That's a tough one man I uh you know we have so many people So many volunteers and leaders in the organization Who like start off you know Super passionate, super into it Take on different roles There'll be a elementary school lead Middle school lead, director of VP All these roles that we have And I think you can see them learning and growing And they want to do more But at a certain point maybe they'll be like You know at the end of the year When we start thinking about next year's roles And cycles you know Promotion so to speak They'll just be like look like I think um I want to change what I'm doing in FDA Or I think I'm going to take a break for a year Because I want to go and pursue this other passion I have or try this other thing And like we want to be supportive of that I think as a leader I first will always try to be like Is there something an FDA that you can do That you know you can still contribute to the organization But you don't have to you don't enjoy the current role Can we change things up But if not like look that's best for you And if you're ever free to help out We'd love that Keep in touch And if we can never kind of help you Pursue you know whatever you're trying to do next Or you know you just want to reflect and think about what's next Please use us at the sounding board And it's really important for everyone To like figure out their own passion We have a bunch of people Who are students and their high school volunteers Then they're the college team And then eventually like they get busy with like Internship recruiting and stuff like that And like they need to focus on that And so they're going to take a step back in FDA And like we want to be there to help them out Just because you know they've done a lot for the organization And we care about them And many times they're like kind of our friends now But you know everyone should go try to figure out Like what's best for them And that's really important Yeah I completely agree with everything you're saying I think I was talking about something a little bit different Where I'm talking about like Let's say the kid who's just joined debate a year ago Right And they're like trying to get good at debate But really they're only doing it Because they feel like they have to You know Thank you And maybe it's like pressure from parents Maybe it's pressure Just peer pressure Like feeling behind From your other peers Your classmates Whatever it might be Right Like stressed about college You find yourself in an environment Where you're doing it Because you think you have to And you're not really enjoying the process at all Like what do you have to say to someone like that Yeah Yeah I mean it depends on the age level too Right Like our programs will be like elementary middle schoolers But even taking a step back from like our programs Like in high school Let's say like you have a bit more autonomy Right Elementary school like you'll do something Because your parents tell you to and then gum do it Sure In high school Like you have your own autonomy a little bit You can choose kind of what to do Maybe your parents have pushed you Maybe you think like all your friends are doing something And so you have to do it And I would say like It's really good If you're not sure what you want to do in life To try things out Like at the high school level Right It's like like I like you know They have a man I think you did you did debate for a bit It was a senior year And you just come from India Like a couple of months back So there's a little different right But you did debate for a bit I don't know it's like By the end of it if you thought it was for you or not Right But like there would be people like ninth graders Joining debate And you did debate for a bit Then they end up not liking it But at least it's given themselves a chance And also like It should be clear about why you may not like it Like are you not liking it because One or two tournaments he did bad I mean I hear like me and you know How many tournaments do Well we didn't do that well end right Are you not liking it because of that Or are you not liking it because of another reason Like can you try to solve those things And just be very clear in your mind So that you don't feel like you have any regrets But then you also have kind of You know given your best effort But then you know of course give yourself The time to find other things that you might You might be liking It's really important for kids to explore And then that's put a lot of pressure Because then you always have to like do This new extracurricular and all of that It's just it's important to find something And you're passionate about That you enjoy doing And you cannot do that Unless you give yourself enough exposure Yeah And it doesn't have to be through a club It doesn't have to be through like a non-profit It can be through just like Reading something on your own You know So you're getting that out for yourself You know Going and like speaking with people But you got to give yourself that Otherwise it's really difficult Yeah That's fair What you're saying is basically Take a chance on something Commit to it for a set period of time Right Exactly Yeah A month, six months, a year, whatever And then at the end of that reflect And decide whether it's for you or not And move on to other things Exactly But but give it the chance Don't stay in this gray state where it's just like Oh, I have to do this I hate this I'm doing this I hate this You know, limbo Yeah, it's really easy to just be like Oh yeah Like I've been told that I should not do anything That I don't like even slightly Or like it stresses me out slightly Like Just don't do it No, like you You have to put yourself in a slightly uncomfortable situation And actually doing that sometimes Might make you like that activity more Just starting to mouth Right there's the bounce There's the bounce You gotta You gotta do all that So Obviously as the organization has grown There's more responsibility for you In terms of your actions And the impact your actions can have So I'm thinking about Both in terms of what the organization does But also internally The way you set the culture The way you set the atmosphere And how people feel So what sorts of challenges have you run into with that And like was there anything About that responsibility That you didn't expect That you sort of struggled To like manage And like kick care of when it came up Yeah, no cultures like really important Like run a large organization Like you don't want People to think it's too toxic Or that their ideas are not being heard Or that like everyone working Like everyone they work with Like don't Doesn't like them I think really strong communication Really helps Having personal conversations With people that you feel Maybe are struggling In the organization Like they're just not carrying their weight Or they're just not doing a great job And the role they were assigned to And speaking with them Personally not like trying to publicly Yeah Kind of You know Yeah Ridicule them Or whatever the right word is Speaking with them personally About like look here's what we're observing But here are some of the great things That we see and you have potential in as well Like let's work together on On doing that I think a lot of those personal conversations Really help Building the culture of like recognition When someone even does like a small When is really great as well Me Right Like You know Saying like look Like I think you did a really great job And like and share that No matter how small that win is Because I think that makes people really happy And feel feels like they look They're doing this for a reason And you know Just like The whole idea is that like everyone Coming into FDA One one thing we said in the beginning is Everyone in FDA She feel like they're getting something out of it They should not be doing it just for college apps Or not And just being doing it to get volunteer hours Or like the presidential volunteer service award That we're like a certifying organization for And being like that They should be doing it because Maybe some of that But also Also because They feel like they're going to get something out of it Which means that They can kind of join our network And alumni network And you know Have people who are mentors They feel like they can learn something From teaching better Or working on logistics Or working on like social media Or whatever it is They should feel like they've learned something out of it In the many years They're going to be part of FDA As a team member And if not Then you know Have a conversation with us about How we can change that I think that's really important So You know It's not easy to scale And that we're going to do this Because you know Every company says that Like Hey we want you to grow in this company You know We want you to join it Even that like you love You know It's not as easy as that But you got to do that The best way you can Yeah When you talk about having those conversations Obviously they're very important But a lot of times I feel like it's difficult For people to bring those things up themselves Like have you ever run into situations Where as a leader Like You had to take more of an act of role Like speaking up for other people around you Like speaking up for someone Who isn't doing well Or is doing well Yeah So for someone who's not doing well Like maybe It's hard for them to communicate to you That they're having troubles Or that they're showing you something Yeah I mean oftentimes Like especially with like the high school volunteers Not so much with the college team They're still maturing Like they're still learning things They don't even know sometimes That they may not be doing a great job Yeah And we have like structures Of teams of people overseeing them Right It's not just like For example And so You know Those people will communicate Kind of how performance is going With their team And then And then you know They'll kind of figure out And sometimes I'll be looped in as well About like What's a strategy Like how are we going to speak With this individual Yeah You know I speak to them And not make them feel like They're in a corner And they're doing a bad job And like we're going to like Remove them as a lead of the school No Like Look we hear what we observe Here's what you're doing great Can you can you try doing this Or can you can you Let us know when you feel like You might be getting stuck here Having like a bit structure In place for having the communication Is it really important Without making it too official To scary Again it's not profit It's not like A job It's paying you like You know $600,000 Whatever it is Everyone's doing it Because they're passionate about it Or for free You know And so You got to make sure It's not too intense But also like The quality is good So Yeah Got you Do you feel like That structure Was pretty like Natural and easy to build up As the organization scaled Or do you feel like That was something where Yeah like Did you run into any obstacles That No No Of course not easier Ha ha In the beginning In the beginning it was a lot Like more free for all Like Yeah I was like For everything Me and the other co-founders But no I think like Over time We've learned where structures Make sense Turned out makes sense And we have to keep Adapting it in a rating 100% Yeah It's definitely a process I also like Kind of To both of your points Like people change And like young people have changed Yeah They communicate The professionalism With which they communicate The expectations of like What they know with technology And all that have changed And so You kind of have to adapt to that Like now I'm turning 26 this week I'm working with oftentimes Like high schoolers Sometimes You know And teenagers And like The world has really changed And so Their attention spans Are different Some of them are like They're professional Do they have TikTok brain Is that what you're trying to say? No They're talking We don't have such Italian brain run animals We all have true attention spans But you know Like this young generation Like group of phones Since they were kids You know We didn't have phones It's over like 13-14 Or something like that And so Like it's just different It's like not even their fault And so We have to like Understand that generation Which is not easy That's been a struggle We do whatever we can to do that And also like they want to say Everything's become so competitive these days And so suddenly now what's happened Is that High schoolers And even the college team They would have a lot of time to work on FDA The average person would have a lot of time And like it was a cool opportunity now There's like a million opportunities they all do They all have like 10 internships They all do like 10 research opportunities Whether they're super legit or not You know that's fine If it's the high schoolers in the end But they all have a lot going on So we have to like adapt or structure around that as well And make sure that like The people that are really going to put in a lot of effort That are really into it We really work with them And the others like We kind of design the structures That it makes sense And you know It doesn't put too much on one person And so that flexibility and adaptation Is like really important Yeah, it gives an example But unexpected challenge Adapting to the youth I mean in general just like professionalism is a component Yeah I don't even know actually like If the youth are more professional or less professional than us Like I go back to say what might we know as I wrote Yeah I'll give a funny story in like 8 6 6 or 7th grade I you know I was really into cricket And I became baseball Because it was like a local baseball league You know I'm spring And you know I really wanted to play cricket And I was like really into that sport And I found like a local cricket league And you know like classic me Like I went and like did all the research about it A 6th grader And then I emailed the director of that cricket league Some adults And you'd cricket league And I was like Hey I would be interested in joining this team Please get to me ASAP I did not write an email And I know that The email was important I mean they responded really kindly And I actually joined that cricket league And it was great I did it for a couple of years And I really enjoyed it But I don't know if younger people Younger kind of youth would do that I think a lot of them actually know how to write emails a little better Sometimes Sometimes they're not as professional But sometimes in many ways They just have a little bit more like A little bit more eloquent And like you know they know a little bit more of like email standards And professionalism Even like in high school I feel like I Sometimes it some of the emails are right And I'm like what am I saying you know You sure that's not just like chat GPT True true No this is just like pretty chat GPT too Even like 2021 2021-22 I feel like yeah Again I can say some people are more professional But some people are just like They don't even know the basics It's kind of a mix So I'm still like wrapping my mind around What exactly is happening You'll never figure it out I probably won I probably won And I think that's kind of the point Like Yeah It's gonna keep changing Yeah You always have a diverse array of people And like skill sets And every generation changes You know with skill sets And there's strengths and weaknesses So that's how it's supposed to be Otherwise it's kind of boring Yeah Is there Rusha, is there anything That's left in your brain To be picked on? I don't think so I feel like we talked a lot The organization like I have one more question Which is just like Across the board What do you think the most challenging thing About running the organization has been? Yeah it's just trade-offs man We've talked a lot about it today Yeah I spend time on FBA Which means that like I can't hang out with friends I gotta say no to things Can't go to impromptu trips Right I can't join you both in things You know I've done it many times You know I probably can't really At least until we figure out Like a hiring strategy or anything If I wanted to Probably I'm not going to be able to move a city Uh, most of different city Right I think we talked about that last year Because like you know I want to be here Where where things are That's important for me right now Even if I want to Right And so Yeah just like balancing that Is like really tough Um And just being okay with the fact But sometimes If work is really stressful Like FBA is actually going to have to Take the backseat Because like you know My job is important I get paid for it And I need to make a living And you know we're not paying Pair your paying ourselves in FBA Right now or anything like that And just being okay with that Um and then I think one thing That's like really helped me Is Thinking about in any situation The worst case scenario The base case scenario And the best case scenario Like just planning weekly and monthly And being like Here's what's going to happen in my life At work My social life And FBA And here's the worst that can happen Here's the base case Here's the best case And For each of these things And kind of planning that on a weekly Monthly even daily basis Sometimes when I wake up And that way I'm just prepared for when things don't go well And I'm able to bounce back quicker Uh it's a skill I think I've developed a lot Over the years and you know I'm gonna have to keep developing it But it's important Actually what you just said I started doing that too Where if something is giving me a lot of anxiety Like some conversation Like like a heavy conversation Or like a performance review Whatever it might be Like Like just mapping out the worst case And just being at peace with it It really takes a lot of that power out of it That it has a review And absolutely That's a really cool skill to have It keeps you happier When things go slightly better than the worst case It's a very good grounding technique To make sure that like you also don't blow it out of proportion In your mind And it's just like Okay I know what the worst case is If it happens It's gonna happen And I know that I'm not gonna die Or like my life's not gonna end And mentally what's your strategy If the worst case happens And how are you gonna deal with it Which you know you may not always have the answer to These are something done But at least like You kind of start preparing your mind for it And your mind kind of does some Some wonders in the background While whatever event or Conversation or Whatever project you're working on Whatever it is Yeah I wish they I wish they taught us this in school Where like there's so many There's so much So so many holes we could avoid it Bro like Remember the cheating scandal Oh no The famous Anyways I feel like We should wrap up But Yes Great conversation Hopefully I feel like we've gained some High school listeners Question Question

are killing it Appreciate you boss man I actually listen to Some of the episodes again As well It's kind of wild Like to go back And Be like Oh that's what I said That's great I like don't you remember Most of the conversations I haven't listened back yet I feel like I don't know I Like I know I definitely want to at one point I feel like for me It's kind of I don't know Does it ever feel weird to you Like listening back To like the earlier episodes And seeing Like your perspective then No I guess it's just a me thing I mean it might be different But that's the point We're growing right Yeah for sure Yeah I mean Sorry Sorry to leave you hanging like that No no It's good I mean I know sometimes I just like Go back and like Read things that I written Or I've said And I'm just like Damn I really was that guy Like in a back The way or in a good way I mean it's more Like a kind of like You know when you listen To your own voice recorded And it feels kind of weird Like the fact that it's you But it doesn't really feel like you anymore Just like in that way It's like a different you Yeah Your voice always sounds Weirder To you yourself Right? Because you're not listening to yourself externally And also Also yeah Like you start becoming really critical of yourself Yeah Yeah And like you know I'm probably going to listen to this And think that I spoke too fast I promise you that's not the problem Everyone I talk to tells me That they listen to me Specifically on 2x Because I just talk the way you two slow I definitely do that I was The other day I was listening to I was watching the show And slow motion I was listening to one of the episodes And The other one was on 2x And then I hear it was talking for a bit And I had to go back to 1.2x But it's good to speak slow I feel like You know You can articulate every word More carefully Be careful what you say And worst case With these days Someone can just listen to you in 2x You know A HOC
