 I'm sorry. Well I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe you're here. I don't know what I'm signing up for and you definitely have no idea where you're going. You're signing up for it. But I guess you're here. So thank you for coming from believing that my incoherent neurotic rambling is worth your time. A lot of you were gracious enough to send me questions so that this episode is actually not a complete train wreck. So thank you so so much. If I don't get to your question for some reason, I will for sure address it in a future episode. As I said, I kind of have no idea what I'm doing. So we'll just see how this goes. Also, if you have thoughts or comments or you want to make fun of me or whatever, like do it in the Spotify comments so that other people can see that and hopefully that'll help me drive some engagement. So I'll start with the big question on everyone's minds. That's the question that you lightweight thinking about a night. The question you randomly remember, will you're taking a shit where you're about to hit a PR at the gym or while you're on a walk in the woods in the sun setting and the squirrels are going to their dens and the air is crisp and everything is beautiful and then it just hits you like a truck. What happened to the room's leg? So on June 1st, I was playing soccer in Brooklyn with a group of very chill, friendly, competitive, funny people. It was a great time. It was just like one of those things that really just take you out of any bullshit that's going on in your head and your life. They just put you right there on the field and playing and laughing and you know, that's the dream. That's the dream. I'm totally going to be like a Sundayly on goal one day. So anyway, we're having such a great time and I even scored goal from like halfway out. But towards the end of the night, while I was like kicking the ball with my right foot and trying to like pass the ball up the field to my teammate and so my left foot was planted. And then I don't know what happened exactly. It's kind of blurry like maybe someone ran into me or I don't know, but my left knee twisted and I remember going down in pain and like not being able to move. So then I get like how like getting off the field and going home and stuff and basically I couldn't like put any pressure on the foot at all. So then I go to urgent care the next day. By the way, this is asked because I live in a walk up and like four flights of stairs up and we have stairs in our apartment to to like get from the living room to the to my bedroom and like the bathroom downstairs. Anyways, it's a mess. So I go to the urgent care in the morning. They look at my foot. They take an X-ray. They're like, okay, nothing looks broken. So your knee is definitely out of place a little bit. It just looks off and it's like insanely swollen. So they give me crutches and then they give me a referral to for the ortho. So then the next day I think you get an appointment with the ortho. I don't want to say orthodontist. It's an orthopedic. The orthopedic and bro looks at my knee and goes, yeah, I think you probably need an MRI. It's like, yeah, we're not shit. Yes, of course I need an MRI. Then he refers me to the radiologist. So he ordered an MRI and said I had to call the radiologist. So I called him and I found out that the earliest I could get is in like a week. And the radiologist was like, I could have gotten it earlier. If I had an orthod for my insurance, so I called the insurance and they're like, we don't see a request. Please tell your doctor to the mid one. So I call my doctor and it was like, please submit a request. So I can get an orthod for an earlier appointment. They're like, okay, bad. And then they were like, okay, so insurance denied the order. So we sent an appeal. You'll hear back in 24 to 48 hours. So I called the insurance and they're like, I don't know, we don't see anything in our system. The system probably denied it, but the appeal should go through. This whole process is just so insane to me because it's like, I was so lost and I feel like if you don't know the right things and really push the right people to make something happen, then it's not going to happen. And the system can really like take you for a ride. Anyways, I eventually figure the whole situation out. So I'm able to get them or I fly home because it was just like too inconvenient for me to be in New York. I'm fly home in California. You know, I don't have to like climb any stairs or anything. So I get here. My report comes back. It said horizontal tear in lateral and the nescus. And they gave me a CD with my images on it, which is insane to me that that's how it's done. But now I have to find an ortho here. So I try to find an ortho, I have to call like 15 different places before I find somewhere within appointment the next day. So I go and the doctor looks at my images and then looks at my knee and he's like, there's no tear. I don't know what they're talking about. You just dislocated your pizzeria. Not even a dislocation. It's just like it came out of place a little bit and then it's slid back. And so you just have to do a bunch of physical therapy and it was kind of a relief. So long story short, I dislocated my kneecap and now I am rehabbing in California and I'm still on crutches. And you know, it's going well. It's not the worst. I still have crutches, but maybe like a few days from being able to like live around by myself. And honestly, I feel like it's a life experience. You know, I'd never broken anything before in my life. I mean, I've spread my ankle here and there, but nothing more dramatic than that. So it was, I guess it was like due in a way, you know, I'm just kind of taking it as one of those like character defining moments, character not character defining. One of those like character development arcs, you know, it's a plot point in the grand scheme of things and it adds to the lore in a way. So yeah, yeah. But again, like it, it's just so crazy to me that you've jumped through so many hoops to get the right people and the right diagnosis. And this process can take like two or three or four times as long if you're not like out there making those calls and begging everyone to get their shit together. Yeah, like if I didn't have such a flexible job or like zero responsibilities outside of myself, like this would have been insane. So it kind of makes you think about, you know, what happens when someone who does have those kinds of responsibilities and doesn't have like a super flexible job, like maybe that to go into work, like that's a really hard thing to do. I mean, this by itself is really hard, but like not being able to move around. But like, you're like dependent on that for your job. That's just, that's insane. But yeah, I mean, I've been confined to my quarters, especially at the beginning. I was watching a lot of movies. I watched like the first five mission impossible movies. I don't know, they are pretty iconic. They're like, I feel like it's a very genre defining series. And I can see the influence that it's had on other movies. Like I will say there is like a motorcycle sequence in M.I. 5, which is like straight out of doom. So I guess it goes both ways. Also, the thing I didn't like about the series was that the female leads never go across movies. And it's kind of sad because like I'm interested in their backstories and I want to see them again. But nope, there's like a new fresh hot, mysterious new woman to feast your eyes on. I mean, it's not like, I'm not like complaining that hard, but like, I don't want to sound performative, but I guess it is what it is. Honestly, like, I've had a good time so far, you know, keeping myself occupied with a lot of things and slowing down is nice. But also I feel like, I don't know what it is for me. I feel like I'm still running out of time. Even though I can't really go anywhere, I have so many things that I like on my list to do every single day. Like I'm reading, like, you know, obviously I have my physical therapy exercises and PT and going to PT. I have a full-time job. Work on my podcast. Watch movies, meditate, sleep, get all your sleep in, chill, spend time with family. I don't know. It's a lot. Somehow, like, I'm still running out of time. There's what I'm trying to say and that's like insane to me. So I have to like, some like working out for you and that out. Alright. Let me go through some of your questions. This sounds classic, I guess, but what's it like being single? Um, fun, honestly. It's a good time. Once you get kind of comfortable with being by yourself, it's like, damn, I kind of don't have space for anyone else in my life right now. There's just so much going on. If you don't feel like that, maybe you need hobbies that you're passionate about or a social life or honestly, like, just other single friends. I think the environment matters a lot. Go to the city, pay rent. R.S. had this back when we did the breakups episode. Gara said this one line that kind of stuck with me. She said, the way you live your life every day is how you end up living your life. Like it's such a simple statement, but, you know, when you kind of sit with that, it really makes you care about your every day a little bit more. You're not taking anything to the grave, you know, like, you're not taking any money, any achievements to the grave. Like, join a class, enjoy your life. Like, I've been focusing on just doing things that I feel like doing in the moment, kind of following the feeling. Join random classes, you know, I joined a, it's yet to start, but I joined a music theory class. I mean, I've been traveling a lot. I went and lived in Hawaii for a month and a half and I made some, that's amazing, amazing people, made some friends who I will be traveling with again. I made a friend offer at it in the city, which is kind of crazy. Honestly, I feel like the energy matters a lot. My focus is to just be a good person to everyone. Don't force it. You'll find the right people. I used to, well, I still do, but, you know, sometimes you get, you try to initiate friendships because you think you might gel well with someone, some group of people and maybe nothing comes out of it, you know, it happens sometimes. Just don't take it personally. You put your energy in, it's time to move on to something else. And when it comes to like friendships dating, just, I think the biggest thing is to not treat it like a game, you know, you make, you make meaningful connections. That's the point of this all. Like, and then along the way, maybe you find someone that you gel with and maybe you want to, you know, take it further, but that's, that's a separate, separate thing, right? That shouldn't be the goal with which you're living your life, at least from where I'm sitting at, you know, my age and you may be in a different phase of life. I can't really comment on that, but that's how I see it at least. Oh yeah, I mean, it's nice, it's fun. You know, I get a lot of time to myself to do things like, you know, this podcast and I don't have to like weigh that over, you know, talking to someone at night or, you know, hanging out with a partner or being worried about someone else, you know, I can travel, I can like focus on routine. I think I've really appreciated that, the space to like figure out what is working for me, what kinds of things I like. That was very, I mean, maybe it's just a meeting, but I was very neurotic about the way that I live my life where I just wanted to do everything, but felt like I wasn't making progress on anything. So as a result, it was always just stressed out. So kind of in doing a lot of that has been really, really helpful. So that's why I kind of appreciate the time. It's funny, like I'm like training myself to be off my phone more. You know the feeling where you just keep like reaching for your phone, checking for messages, like especially if you're like at home on a Friday night or something, you just kind of, I found myself kind of like reaching for my phone, seeing what's there. Like I think there's a term for it, the thing is called ghost message syndrome or something or just like kind of my list list scrolling on Instagram, you see feel, you know, maybe a little bit anxious or foam or whatever it is. I've been training myself to just be like, nobody's messaging you. She's leaving us shit. Like nobody, nobody, there's no end. And it's funny because a lot of times I say that and there are people in the world, in my life who, you know, message me and I'm very, very thankful for them. But it's been, it's been cool to kind of try to be away from my phone as far as much as possible and kind of be lost in wherever I'm at. But yeah, you also like, I've not a lot of interesting people since I've been single. I don't know if you guys can relate, but I feel like there's always a one person at every party who will like show up, tap you up, say, stop man and then that's it. Nothing. Radio silence. Like what's going on? You know, working shit. Like it is so funny. Like you'll walk around tapping up people and then 30 minutes later you'll look around and he's gone. Yeah, you need some funny people. I met a girl once who watches TikToks during movies because she gets too bored of them. And I just, I lost it. I couldn't, I couldn't see that person again. I met people who like can't stay off their phone because we're keeps calling, you know, classic like IP stuff. Yeah, I kind of met someone off Reddit. Just very randomly like someone who was like into electronic shows and stuff. I also met this one girl who'd go to clothes with her number and down on little pieces of paper and then just hand them out to every came and talk to her. Like it's insane. She actually got thrown out once because of that. Yeah, I mean, you meet people who lie, who ghost, who make you feel, you know, bad about yourself. Like it's who want to, you know, play the game. They want the chase. All that stuff. They want the full princess treatment, etc., etc. Yeah, that's New York. All that being said, there's also a lot of, you know, mostly when you're around your friends who have been together for a long time or getting married or engaged or whatever. But, you know, there's this kind of feeling that this kind of ache or it's like you want someone to kind of bear witness to your life. I feel like that's what it kind of boils down to. And, you know, that person, obviously not just any person just has to be something, have to be special enough to be the one to bear witness to your life, you know, I don't know. That's how I feel at least. And honestly, like, I feel like I'm generally happy with where I'm at. But it did take me a while to get to this point, you know. I had to like, work through a lot of different feelings, a lot of trauma, a lot of, you know, solving that puzzle, kind of, you know, what happened, kind of just going back and analyzing every little thing like what happened, how did it happen, why did it happen? I've had to work through like making excuses for other people for treating you poorly. Eventually, if you kind of realize that, you know, you're flawed, like everyone else. That doesn't mean someone can treat you like shit. Someone treating you like shit comes from the fact that they're flawed. And eventually you just have to let that stuff hurt you. You can't really rationalize why someone hurt you. It doesn't really work. It doesn't matter how, you know, good of a person they are, people aren't good or bad. They're just flawed in different ways, different degrees and broken. And then sometimes you get stung by those broken pieces and they hurt. And so, I just had to come to terms with that. But, yeah, you know what gets me sometimes is the loneliness, you know, the feeling that nobody really gets it. And it's just, you can drive you crazy. It's, you know, you can have parents who love you very much and they're flawed in their own ways. But they literally take a bullet for you right? And then so many other people that care in their own ways. If you kind of break an arm or fall sick, you literally have, you know, grandparents or friends and people who would call you to see if you're okay and if you need anything. You know, if you, this is very more but not, but you know, if you died, there would be so many people who would mourn your absence. And yet, like what you feel lonely, like nobody understands you, nobody quite gets it. It's just, it's different. Maybe it's the fact that, you know, the world you grew up in is so different from the world that, you know, maybe your parents did it and you're trying to bridge that gap between their world, which is also your home world. And the world you're growing up, which is the one that you have to live and succeed in and where your social structures are. Maybe you have friends that, you know, love you, but nobody really gets it. So that feeling of, I don't know where it comes from, it's just so duplicitating sometimes. And I don't really have a point to this rant. That feeling is obviously, I mean, not obviously, that feeling I feel like I was better gone better over the years as I've, you know, loved and lost and grown and gone to therapy and connected with different parts of myself and different people in different capacities. And yeah, I mean, let me rephrase. Like it's not about it getting better. I've just, I've just learned to see it and feel it. I acknowledge that, you know, we're all separate and unique, but we're also all connected and shared. And loneliness and melancholy are beautiful feelings. Sometimes it just points to some need of yours that isn't being met. Are you able to feel joy by yourself? Do you have fun in your own company, you know? Like can you go, are you able to go out and have a meal, ball by yourself and enjoy that meal? Are you stuck, you know? Are you scared of something? Do you crave connection? I feel like a big problem is when you feel really fully connected to one person and then you lose that person, you kind of shut off. A lot of people, a lot of, especially guys fall into that trap. I done it. Maybe, you know what? Let me explain a little bit more. Think one of you asked me, what my, what the hardest thing or biggest life change was, here it is. Let's say you meet someone that truly sees you, you know, like just sees you. They look at you in the eyes and through your soul and say, I understand your pain and you understand that, right? And you know, things happen and people change and grow and need different things. But when you lose something like that, it just completely, it can completely break you. And you're losing the validation to your existence. Like what am I enduring all the suffering in my world for? You know, am I too much? If the person that knew me best needs something different, and I say need something different because that's what it is. But what it feels like is this person is choosing to not be with me anymore, you know, it's a rejection. What does that mean? Obviously, there's two ways that this manifests, that this like really uncomfortable feeling manifests, especially if you don't understand it, are able to see how people grow, which is a valid one because the moment is just so intense. You have to put all that blame somewhere. So one way is to blame the other person. You know, they did this, they did that, how dare they, they're a demon, etc., etc. And the other way is blaming yourself for everything, you know, I must be ugly inside. I have problems. It's my fault. This was my one chance at happiness and I blew it. And I think, you know, to make it stand, I chose that path initially. I've truly, truly seen the depths of my despair, you know, like that falling feeling, I feel like I fell all the way to the bottom. Slowly you take time to just feel that stuff and invest in yourself and your other relationships. You seek out new people and different kinds of people and share different parts of yourself and bits and pieces and you start to get validation from your own existence from yourself. You learn that you have to live life because it's worth living. And guess what? Like it's only going to be worth living if you set it up so that you're not miserable every day, you know, you got to think you have to give yourself, I keep going back between yourself and I, I'm just going to say yourself, you got to give yourself like small acts of happiness, a couple of cocoa in the morning. If that helps you start your day, it feels nice in your throat. Maybe yoga, a couple of times a week, you know, ice cream on Fridays, maybe on Monday if you're feeling crazy, you know, like be authentic. This is who I am. I'm figuring it out obviously. But he's our some of my values. Be compassionate. Be interested in other people's lives. Start looking at your parents as people, you know, as friends. You'll start noticing how I started noticing how people's journeys mirror each other and yours in interesting ways. It just takes time. It may not be the most efficient way, but I think when you start seeing and feeling all that is when you start feeling a little bit less lonely and, you know, figuring out where I got stuck, I think that's the greatest skill ever. The skill to get yourself unstuck, self-help, you know. Obviously, like now that I'm saying it, I'm worried that maybe I'm not thinking enough about other people's experiences, you know, like depression is not a choice, right? That stuff is excruciating. When you're in a hole like that, so often, what does helping yourself even mean? Pretending? You know, that's the whole jar of warms I don't even want to get into. The point is like it's just stupid when you feel lonely, even if you have so many cool people in your life. But there's ways to help yourself set up your life so that you're able to be a good host. When all that stuff comes up, so you're not bouncing off the walls when it's there, when you feel it, you just feel it and that sucks, keeping perspective. You know, I mean, I talked about this in previous episodes, but a lot of my influence helped me a lot of, you know, telling myself that I'm this guy, I'm not this storm. I'm the ocean, not the waves, just that perspective that muscle helps a lot. Breathwork coming from my nervous system down. I think that's what it was. My nervous system was flared up for so long. It was just on fire all the time. And so, and that stuff stays with you, you know, I've been reading this book called The Body Keeps the Score and it's just, it's scary how much what internalized trauma can do to your body. And how it just kind of stays there and rewires you. And so recognizing that is really important. There's an excerpt from Rumi that I keep coming back to. I want to read it to you guys. Rumi for those of you don't know is a Persian poet, ending from the 14 hundreds or so. But here's the, the poem is titled a community of spirit. It goes, there's a community of the spirit. Join it and feel the delight of walking in the noisy street and being the noise. Drink all your passion and be a disgrace. Close both eyes to see what the other eye. Open your hands if you want to be held. Sit down in the circle, quit acting like a wolf and feel the shepherd's love filling you. At night, your beloved wanders. Don't accept consolations. Close your mouth against food. Taste the lover's mouth in yours. You moan. She left me. He left me. Anymore will come. Be empty of worry. Think of who created thought. Why do you stay in prison when the door is so wide open? Move outside the tangle of fear thinking. Live in silence. Flow down and down in all ways widening rings of being. That's the thing, isn't it? It's your crying inside screaming at the top of your lungs. Nobody understands you. The heart. You're waiting for someone to come and save you. Nobody's coming. Heck, you don't want anyone to come. Because at the end of it all, they're just going to change their mind and leave anyways. The problem here obviously is that, and okay, like I'm very much thinking through a lot of this, like with you guys. So it's not like I have this. I'm not preaching. This is just my thoughts, my rant. The problem I feel like is in fact the lead. It's holding the fear that it will end. The problem is rooted kind of in the fact that maybe you don't have a strong enough bearing on the ground. What does your life look like if it's just you? Are you able to be okay by yourself? You know, are you going to be okay if there is no one else to pair witness to your life? Will you still live your life? Every relationship ends. Either someone grows out of it, someone changes their mind, someone cheats, someone dies, whatever it will end. Maybe if you're lucky it will be the first to go, but that's more than that. It's just, it's going to end and you're going to have to deal with it. Are you at peace with that? Relationships end. But the ability to love and be loved does. You just may not be able to feel it for a bit. You know, I think the biggest change I've been trying to bring is, am I okay with loving without expectation? Are you able to love knowing that grief is the natural compliment to it? I feel like if your heart is closed, then let it be closed. Recognize that it's closed and listen to how it's suffering and sit with it and make friends with it and all that, all this, but it blew to stuff. And cry, you know, cry, be kind to it and to others as much as you can and naturally it'll open up one day. Then once you're ready to be held again, you have to open your arms. That's the thing from the roomies poem that I keep coming back to. It might be my favorite line, which is, open your arms if you want to be held. What's the worst that could happen? It doesn't work out. You still have yourself. But yeah, it's something I keep telling myself. So that's your long-winded answer of what might be a change in life. Okay, as it goes into this other question, that's what is the biggest thing I'm working on right now. It's acceptance, like accepting multiple truths at the same time. It's easy to blame other people and it's easy to blame yourself. But I've realized that both of these are about controlling the narrative, you know, like creating a story that fits the data points. So what I'm working on, what I've been working on for a long time, is how to balance both of that. You know, I'm flood and they're flood and I was wrong in some things and they were wrong in some things, but I still have a right to feel heart. I've been through like a long period of not allowing myself to feel how I was feeling and it made me all, you know, messed up and second-guessing every, like, internal feeling I had. I think it's kind of typical for an older sibling, especially like first-gen older siblings. We're figuring so much out for yourself and for other people in your life. And that's the book that I was talking about. The body keeps the score. So I've been kind of validating my own experiences and learning that you can't take the responsibility for someone else's happiness. No matter how hard that might be to do, you can only do so much. There's some things you can't fix with hard work and since you're somethings have to break. And I've learned that there is a natural flow of things sometimes and healthy to try to contort it to make what you want happen. And that's enough. I am so tired of this, all this talk. The left is out about something different now, you know. What the same depressing shit. Alright, what's next? Four people, four different people asked me. By the way, all these questions are coming from our Instagram page, so I put up a story one day saying, hey, send me some questions for my solo episode. And so that's where all these questions are from and if you don't follow the Instagram page you should just find a full plan of rotation. So go, that's kind of the place we try to communicate and share ideas and stuff. So anyways, four of you asked me what my Chipotle order was. So here it is. Well the classic, my classic Chipotle order is a bowl with either, if they have like a special kind of chicken, then I do that like a honey chicken works really well in the, sometimes they have an alipast store chicken, which is also pretty good. But if they don't, then they go have chicken and have sofritos. Brown rice, always brown rice. I don't know, it just, for some reason it tastes, I think it tastes better. But maybe it's just because I feel slightly healthier. But you know, whatever. Black beans, fajitas, pico, verde, corn, cheese, guac and lettuce. But it's funny, like the day that I posted the question story, I used a picture of me eating Chipotle burrito and the lake. And so obviously I got a burrito that day because I was like, you know what, I should live a little sometimes, fuck it, I want a burrito. And that may not seem like much depending on who you are as a person. But to me it's kind of like a healing thing because it's hard. It's hard to let go of the, you know, get a bowl and a tortilla so you get more, get a gawk on the side so you get more, you know, like all that kind of stuff. I completely understand that this is a very, maybe a tech bro kind of thing to do, but very typical tech bro kind of thing to do. But it is what it is. Ambekah asked me, what is my favorite podcast? So podcasts that have liked over the last few years, not so much as recently, the Duncan Trussle family hour. This is actually like, if you haven't seen the Midnight Gospel on Netflix, go watch it. Amazing, amazing show. Very short. It's like maybe six or seven episodes and they're each like, not more than 15, 20 minutes. So for that show they've pulled audio from this podcast, the Duncan Trussle family hour and kind of overlaid a bunch of cool animation towards it and on it and gave it a little bit of a storyline. But very, very cool stuff. So this guy has a lot of content out, but and honestly I found some of the more recent ones to get a little weird and controversial, but I like his older stuff. Specifically the episodes he records with different kind of spiritual people that talk about like, you know, some names being like Krishna Das and Jack Cornfield and Trude Goodman. I feel like I learned a lot about my own neurotic tendencies because Duncan is so neurotic and different ways of approaching life. You know what I feel like the battle really is sometimes is just like us humans, like the way we perceive things and are able to think about things in our lives and stuff. It just seems so unnatural. Like I know dolphins and stuff are decently smart, but if you look at like most life was meant to just survive and reproduce. What is the motivation for this survival? I have no idea. Like if you take one singular cell and we know that it will try to survive through however the cell splits, what I forget was called like bi-imficion or you know if it's like a more complicated cell than maybe spores or sex or but like what is the real motivation like why survive? I don't know. So like most of life is just instinct based and where and we have a we have a whole universe of shit going on in our heads. You know we got trauma and jealousy and love and situationships and codependence and mental illness and the ability to be super materialistic and be into like crazy like kinky stuff. Like we have so much going on that we could be lost in thought about the way some dude yelled at you at the subway for not moving out of you know out of his way or something. Like there's so much complexity in thought and emotion and things that we you know and how we perceive things but like why you know like what is what is the point of all that really just kind of making trying to make sense of why we all have all these powers and so it's like putting a baby in charge of a super computer you know like what the hell is it going to do also like why the hell is there super computer in the first place. All that to say like some of this content and he calls it dharma talk is just they're going through concepts of Buddhism like spirituality you know pitfalls of the mind understanding death understanding grief your own neuroticism like that's what's helped me kind of learn the controls a little bit to be more at ease you know at peace the other one I like is smartless I don't know if you've heard smartless but forget who put me on was it I think it was a thick but yeah smartless is so funny and the chemistry between those three guys is just off the charts it's just a great listen sometimes when you just want to listen to someone talk some people talking kind of almost feel part of the conversation that's a that's a really good one and you know we learn things about people because they're all like you know famous people who have made it in different ways and worked a lot of different jobs and stuff. Sahel Gil asked me what is my best travel story this question is really funny because I met Sahel at the full moon party in Thailand on Copenhagen and that stuff was perhaps the most insane experience in my life like let me fill you in so as I realize I never talked about this but Copenhagen is a silent I don't know if you guys I haven't really watched it but I know because my roommate watched it white lotus in the last season they do a bunch of stuff in Thailand on and they I think they show the full moon party in one episode so yeah that thing I went to that thing on this island in like southern the Gulf side of Thailand this place is like a is is a whole island full of completely degenerate like Russians and Europeans and you know British and and I you know some of these people are really sweet but and I so I say degenerate in a half endearing way but let me give you two kind of stories that will help paint the picture so the first night I was there I went to this thing called a jungle grave this was the night before a full moon party and it was a great great setup like they had like three different stages one of our friends who we made at the hostel decided to go walk home by himself from the venue and it was like four a.m something like that and so he left and started walking down from the venue and this time man comes up to him with a big gun around his shoulder like on his stomach and he goes and he is a bag of coke in his hand and he's trying to put it in this guy's bag my friend's bag and he says I'm going to pin this on you and so the district dude just runs down the hill and goes through and there's another guy waiting for him a police man so they're kind of in on it and they're probably gonna extort him or something and then so he rents into the jungle and then he calls us and he's like please come help me he's like hyperventilating he's like please come help me some come get me so we go try to find him at like 4.15 a.m. 4.30 a.m so we're bringing back and then we go home the next day is a full moon party and this is the most insane event I've ever witnessed in my life like it is a whole it's a huge beach full of maybe like a line of 12 or 16 clubs in a line all blasting some version of electronic music and so you can hear all of them at the same time from the beach and there's like fireworks going above on top of you and people are playing with fire they're like pissing in the ocean they're they're serving pills at the bar like pills of like obviously some mixture of like meth or molly and it's crazy because you have no idea these are safe like the only data point you have is that nobody else seems to be dying which I don't know maybe that's enough but that was the deal there and then there were these boats going to the secret exclusive party called Eden on the other side of like the cliffs or whatever and so so people are taking these boats and they're drunk out of their minds are on so many drugs like and these are tiny tiny boats so like they go out into the ocean and it's dark and it's the ocean so it's like it's like not like calm it's the same like we read on on Reddit we saw a post that two days ago two boats going to Eden flip and like a bunch of people that went missing and stuff and so and then it was just like business as usual that day which was insane so yeah uh co-paying in um full moon it was also the New Year's edition of full moon which I've heard is the craziest full moon but in general I would say like it is an experience but don't and oh oh yeah also a lot of people drive scooters there when they're completely out of their minds and so we actually saw someone fly like off the road into the jungle because there was a turn and the bro just didn't turn yeah apparently like stuff like that happens over there every day so anyway yeah I would say that is my best travel story um but no I mean I really enjoyed going to Costa Rica too uh I think lots of growth came out of that taking that leap it's where I kind of you know dove alpha cliff and uh for you know tire swing into the river and uh I went surfing and stuff like that and I think those were my baby steps that eventually resulted in me skydiving in Hawaii and going shark diving occasionally shark diving both were pretty fun experiences next size asking me what is my hottest take hmm I think people need to be more open to things I think my hot take is that I've noticed that people have too many opinions and rules like just shut up and listen sometimes you know be a be a sponge there's like many valid trains of thought I feel like you would just see the other side better if you were more open also also people are so anxious about food like you tried what with what why would you put X on Y that just sounds stupid like no it doesn't pitch like how do you think the food we have today was created is centuries of just trying shit and seeing what sticks and there's so many combinations and things out there there get to be discovered or you know popularized so my hot take is that cooking isn't that hard and people are too scared of not using a recipe and messing things up like ingredients are like colors you just need to kind of try things together complementary flavors and textures like we can invent new dishes you don't need to be a master chef to do that you don't need to go to cooking school like ingredients are just legos you just need to just need to figure out what types of things go together don't use recipes cooking with a recipe is like it's like doing a paint by numbers I sound so pretentious but but if you're here if you're scared about how to cook take a potato dice it take some oil and use one spice you know just one spice and understand the flavor of that spice and go you can make so many different kinds of potatoes like this uh and then you can try to and then you can try using like two together and three together some of you probably hate me for that but that that is my hot take brand of this asking me what is the biggest societal change you are hoping for over the rest of our time sorry lifetimes what is the biggest societal change you are hoping for over the rest of our lifetimes I think I think it would have to be something to do with emotional intelligence being taught in school you know I kind of earlier I talked about the idea of this baby with a super compute you know like teaching kids to not to control their emotions but the controls to their emotions the ability to recognize them so that we can be mindful and like raise a more empathetic generation like so that we raise kids who are more empathetic towards themselves and towards others you know because that's really where I feel like we are stuck what is preventing a lot of us from living fulfilling lives you know like what am I supposed to do when I get angry how do I deal with that what what am I supposed to do when I get sad you know like it's the negative emotions that really really can hurt you if you don't know how to deal with them and you channel it in all these destructive ways yeah yeah so I think that is the biggest one and also just like how we kind of perceive death you know I read somewhere how you live is how you die so if you want to die at peace whole and you know happy you have to live that way and that includes all the hard work and the amount of hard work that people should put in to achieve something it's not just it's not necessarily just sitting on a beach and you know not doing anything with your life we'll do one more. Kartik is asking this did this question is is love a choice this is the question that I've got from Kartik um hi okay like first of all I am no expert on the matter at all like I I will I will go as far to say I know nothing about love like I know that it can happen and it can go away and you know the relationship is beautiful and maybe love is a choice because you know like someone was telling me recently about a conversation they were in with a man who got divorced and he was like how can I trust someone again when they say they want one thing but can completely change their mind and undo everything from the last four years in four months I was I mean I get that whole line of thinking like the answer to me seems like you need to build a strong foundation in yourself so that anyone you date or end of marrying or love is an accessory to your life so that if it ends that you're not like falling down an endless pit I think I think people should be allowed to grow out of relationships without it being so devastating for anyone I think that should be a very completely reasonable thing that happens obviously like nothing is going to save the heartbreak if that's what happens you know you just you just have to go through the grief of it all like it's not I'm not saying there's a way to avoid that because like if you do you're just gonna hold back too much and then regret it later but I feel like it is a setup for failure if you go into something hoping that it's going to last till your last breath how can you keep your heart open to feel everything that life has to offer and like love without expectation I don't know I mean okay like obviously there's just no way there's not going to be expectation if you marry someone which makes like marriage feel like some kind of safety net or a beautiful commitment or handcuffs depending on how you look at it but yeah and literally just rambling now so I'm going to stop uh the original question is love a choice yes no just happens to feeling like any other just needs space for it to enter your life and for it to pass sometimes you know you're you might be in love with someone but your body is trying to tell you something else too and in moments like that you're gonna you just have to listen to your body loving as a choice but it's but you have to pick loving yourself over loving someone else for like the really basic things I'm not talking about like being a nice person to someone I'm talking about like like big life things but yeah holy shit that was a hell of a last hour so I am so I'm really spent I'm going to stop talking and I have no idea how this is going to turn out but I am super glad that you joined me on your journey and honestly I'd like to figure out a way to make this more interactive next time so we'll see we'll see how to do that but thanks guys peace
