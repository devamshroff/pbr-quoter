 Oh, shit. Sorry guys. I just got this new protein shake called Fary Flaxlens and then I've just been farting non-stop. Today's episode of Pineapple Blot Rotation is brought to you by Fary Flaxlens. Have you ever been so tired of the whole process of buying groceries and cooking and seasoning and eating and doing dishes? You might come and say to me, hey, door dash exists. Oh, my credit card gives me dash pass. Well, you still have to deal with online reviews and pictures and decisions and, oh, man, those horrible greedy delivery drivers that call you and tell you to come down. And then you have to chew the food and taste all those flavors and textures and sometimes it's bad. Why put in all that effort when all we really need to do is survive and bench 215 pounds? Like that's obviously the only way to gain respect of other men. Otherwise you just be living your worthless life without counting your calories and macros like some kind of demonic slob of a human being. Don't you just hate when you eat a piece of chocolate and you feel this weird emotion called happiness? That feeling when you're at a birthday party as a kid and everyone's making fun of that weird kid in third grade and drinking juice and the sun's out and you're playing tag on the playground and some auntie hands you chocolate cake. Those memories make me want to puke. This drink lets me skip all that. It has protein and creatine and ushwaganda and caffeine and magnesium oxide. Obviously instead of melatonin, what do you some kind of dumbass who doesn't listen to the Huberman love? Altheonine, testosterone, beetroot powder, trend and BC double A's. I drink this three times a day and it lets me stay my depression and avoid having to engage with the world because honestly what is even the point? I can finally be content with my own masculinity and my 8% body fat. I've been taking it for two months and next week I think I'll finally see the veins on my butt. I think once I do that I'll finally be happy. I'm going to keep making stupid shit like this. Alright, welcome back everyone. I hope you enjoyed that lovely intro prepared by Daveum for y'all. I would just like to put that out there so y'all know it's him to blame and not me. I'm sure they enjoyed it. It's a beautiful misdirection, some intergalactic cable. Of course, of course. Your daily scheduled intergalactic cable. Alright, let's get into it. For today's episode we have very special guest joining us. One of my college buddies from UCLA, Garrett Gerrito, he is a research scientist at a biotech startup. He is one of the funniest people I know. He's emotionally intelligent, thoughtful and overall just an amazing human being. He's also very unapologetically him, which is I feel like that's a rare combination to have, being both emotionally intelligent and unapologetically yourself. I'm very excited to have him on and help us navigate our topic for today, which is Body Image and the Gym. Welcome, Garrett. Thanks so much, Dan. Man, that is quite the flowery intro. I really appreciate it. Yeah, I got to find myself a friend who will ask me up like that. I know. I'm very lucky over here. So how are you guys doing? Just like generally? What is your mental state at the moment? That's a... How do I put this? I would say not the best, but getting better. I feel like the last few weeks have definitely been like pretty stressful and rough for me, but I feel like in a good way where it's like there's a lot in my life that I wanted to change and a lot in my life that I had to change to have the life I want. And I feel like I'm finally making those steps towards that. But then obviously because of that, it's like there's a lot of stress, there's a lot of anxiety, there's a lot of ups and downs. So yeah, definitely good, but work in progress. I heard this line recently on Instagram. It goes, the horror is persist, but so do we. And I just spoke to me in a way that I don't know. Yeah, it hit home. Definitely, definitely. Yeah. I like... There's like another phrase for that, but similar. I like you got to get in to get out. You have to get into the thick of it, like the worst of it in order to get out again. Did the thick of it? Yeah. I forgot about that audio. Oh man, I'm sorry. As soon as you said that, I just had to. He's cut TikTok right there. Garrett, how are you doing? How's life? I would say pretty similar to here. Yeah, it works getting real busy and kind of just starting to settle in. I've definitely been in that adjustment period and just been really busy. So trying to stay on top of sleep and social life and also making time for myself has been a little tough. But yeah, doing okay, doing okay. I feel you have your brother. Literally me right now. Yeah. That's fair. I feel similar. Work is definitely piloting up a little bit. But in a good way, I think I'm getting involved in it once again after not being too interested, honestly. Yeah, I feel like I'm more involved now, which is cool in its own way. It's a good feeling to like stay involved at work, like socially and like being busy. Yeah, yeah. I started watching the Bachelor. It shows fire. I was invited to a Bachelor watch party last year. Is this your first time? Yeah, so this is my first time actually watching an episode. And it's fucking crazy. Like it's most definitely. It's just like what the it feels like I'm watching interdimensional cable. Like what am I? Yeah, that's just the real interdimensional. This would not be real. This is just like attention wars. That's all it is. Have you watched like Love Is Blind? Should like that. I have watched Love Is Blind. But I feel like this is crazier because those shows at least have a bunch of men and a bunch of women. This is just like competing for the same man. There are sisters on the show. I got a fun bachelor fact. I actually know the old host, Chris Harrison. Oh, shit. I went to high school with his kid. So yeah, that's pretty cool. Did you like meet him? Like what's he like in real life? Yeah, he's pretty chill. It was funny. This is now a gossip podcast. I know. At the end of his tenure, he was kind of just like getting sick of it. But it was definitely like paying the bills really well. So he stayed on for a while. But yeah, it lives in a very nice house. Cool dude, though. Cool dude. So the owner of the original bachelor mansion, it's interesting because they only live in their own house half the year because they rented out to the bachelor for the other half of the year. So I thought that was pretty cool too. I have literally never considered that like, where is this house come from? It's really just like in Malvue. Like you can see it from the road. It's like just the normal house that you wouldn't like quite expect to be that mentioned. But I mean, it's huge. But like for Malvue's nerds, it's just like, you know, kind of a house. Yeah. That's actually insane to me that it's like they don't have their own house that they have bought. They just like bum it off someone for half the year. Like a timeshare. It's absolutely insane. Yeah, so the kid that lived there, he used to like, everyone saw he would like forget stuff when he like packed up all stuff to leave the house. And like, he should go back like in the middle of filming. It was really funny. Oh, no. Imagine like leaving something you didn't want your parents to notice somewhere. And it's just on fucking live television for everyone to see you. That's a nightmare, dude. Oh, God. All right. Well, then, well there. Um, anyways, let's, let's, let's, uh, I'll be honest. I completely forgot how we got into this conversation. I started it, bro. I was like, oh, I'm watching the bachelor now. Oh, yeah. Life updates. And now it's time for the best segue in podcasting history. All right. So this episode we're going to be talking about body image, negative body image. And yeah, I think it's something that a lot of us have struggled with and continue to struggle with. Like, yeah, just like staying positive about how you look and how you feel about your body, given like, you know, social media, like regular media, just like that constant barrage of like beauty standards and like beauty norms that we get every day. So I feel like to start off with, um, let's go into body dysmorphia and the feelings that come into that. I'd say body dysmorphia is specifically like those negative feelings you have towards your own body and like that negative, like, like the way you can obsess over parts of your body that appear negative to you and might seem like off. Like, for example, how people might like obsess over their face shape or a little bit of fat that they gain compared to like the week before. And yeah, the negative feelings that can come with that, that feeling that like, oh, now I'm so ugly, like, unattractive things like that. So I feel like to start off with, yeah, let's just go around and share our own experiences with that sort of like negative thinking and like negative body image. So I know if you want to start off, they've. I think for me, having a negative body image like body dysmorphia means being unhappy with the way I look, certain sense of like not being comfortable in my own skin. I definitely dealt with it. I was already at my life for sure. Um, you know, I started as a kid. Obviously, like I wish I was, you know, stronger or faster, whatever, you know, as I grew older, it became, oh, I wish I had a nicer jawline. I wish I had no love handles. I wish I had like a flat, you know, stomach. I wish I had abs like. And I think in a lot of ways, that's kind of where the first, I'd say like critical voice was born in my head. That's the first place I heard it. Or I remember hearing it. I don't think I've dealt with it enough. I think I, I've made a lot less progress on dealing with it as I would have liked. Yeah. But that's kind of where I'm at right now. How about you, here? Pretty similar. Like it's something that I've struggled with growing up. When I growing up, I was like an overweight kid. And I specifically remember like a lot of comments from like my parents constantly like about how I looked like my way comments from like other kids, things like that. And I don't know. It's, it's interesting because I feel like I've always had because of that. Like I had a very negative body image. I never really like, I never felt, oh, I want my body to be better. Like, oh, I want be more muscular. Like obviously there was a part of me that wish I looked better, wished I was thin, wished that I was more muscular. But I feel like for me, I never really like really went to the gym or anything to try to like improve that. I essentially like stood on it for a long time. I sort of hated how I looked. I hated, yeah, my body. But yeah, it was much more, I feel like for a background thing for me. Yeah. And honestly, like I've been kind of like struggling to put my thoughts together about it. And I feel like like you, that's almost because like I haven't really put in the time to like unpack my own feelings that own internalized negative self perception. I feel like a lot of it is still in the background for me. And sort of like colors my relationship to the gym, like my relationship to like my own like sense of self worth. But yeah, it's still something I feel I'm very much in the stages of unpacking. And yeah, I mean, part of the reason why I'm so excited to have this conversation. How about you, Garrett? Yeah. I mean, I think I can echo definitely a lot of things you guys said. Thinking back to, I guess the first time I really started to perceive my own body was probably sometime in middle school or high school. Growing up, I always played sports. I was really, really active. I played a bunch of different sports. But like kind of the sport I was best at probably are the two sports I was best at was like running and basketball. So playing basketball, you're surrounded by kids that are really tall. And then especially as you like move up in levels, like the kids get really tall. Like by the time we were in high school, so you know, some of the players were playing against it like semifital. You know, I totally shit. I'm 5'10 right now. I was always never very tall growing up. So a lot of my friends were like a foot taller than me. And you know, that definitely affected my body image for sure. And so I think that was probably the first time I perceived my own body was like in relation to being shorter than everyone else. And then because I was a long distance runner, I definitely had a skinny or build a small cross country frame, so to speak. And going into college, I was really sick of looking like that, not being short, but being skinny. Obviously, you can't change your height. Well, I guess now you can. There's surgical procedures that can make you taller. Highly don't recommend those permanently paralyze you. So I wanted to make a change. And I had kind of been introduced to lifting my junior year of high school through my, my strength and conditioning coach for basketball. I hadn't really ever taken it seriously, but you know, anytime you start lifting, you kind of get those newbie gains no matter what you do or how well you do it. So I'd put on a little bit of size and got to UCLA and you see it has a really nice gym. So just kind of started experimenting, experimenting around into gym for first two years of college. And then COVID hit junior year. And I had put on some size, but I'm still skinny in my mind. I probably definitely had made a lot of progress in terms of like getting bigger by that point, but COVID happened. And I had a bench and dumbbells at home and a lot of time on my hands. And I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to go hard. So I went really hard in the gym during COVID and then after COVID. And I put on a lot of size. I was training for bodybuilding not to computer anything, just to kind of look my biggest and my strongest. And I put a lot of size on. And then probably about a year or two ago, I ran into a friend who's a powerlifter. And we were working out together and he's like, have you ever trained for powerlifting? I said no. And he told me, you know, you probably have a lot of potential in this. This is something you should consider doing. I didn't know anything about powerlifting at the time. All I knew was that, you know, you squat, you bench, you deadlift, and you try and lift as much weight as you can. And it's definitely a different style of training. Been training for bodybuilding or looking your biggest. You definitely neglect a lot of muscles and your body changes a lot. There's like a meme about like the powerlifter build. It's basically so with like big thighs, big chest, and nothing else. And they're kind of out of shape too. So I've kind of gotten the powerlifter build now that I've been training for for a few years. And I'm trying to lean out again right now. But I guess my relationship with my body has always been one of like self improvement. And I kind of have a lot of negative self-talk. So I probably, I'm not that ever really the happiest with where I'm at. But I definitely think I started perceiving my body image. Sometime in high school, I started perceiving that I needed to change my body image. Sometimes in some time in college. And then I started perceiving that I need to have a positive body image and positive relation to the way I look currently. Sometime towards the end of college. And so, you know, it's kind of been a work in progress ever since. I wanted to ask a little bit more about that transition between realizing you're able to change things. Obviously, like you've made a little good amount of progress in the gym, right? Like you've went from playing sports to having success in the gym to now eventually powerlifting. So obviously you've made progress in strides. And do you think your perception of your own body has improved in that time? And does that relate to like how you've realized that, okay, like I need to work on my image, you know, having a positive body image? Yeah, I think that's a really good question. So I would say that kind of initially, when I first started training, I was trying to just like maximize the way I looked. And so I spent the majority of my training saying, okay, here's what I want to improve. So I would pick like focused muscle groups that like I felt I had that were lacking. And then like train them really hard and just do maintenance on the other muscle groups. And obviously this required going to the gym very frequently. In order to kind of get that level of granularity and detail in my training. And it also required a lot of research on exercise science, physiology, how to select the exercises, how to like improve specific muscle groups in the best way possible. So I spent a lot of time reading like primary literature, like you said, I'm a scientific researcher. So I like reading scientific papers. And there's definitely a lot of exercise nights out there. So I spent a lot of time consuming that. I was just really trying to maximize myself towards the look that I wanted. And while I did make a lot of progress in the gym like that, I kind of felt two things. One, I felt that that style of training was really boring. Basically doing the same exercise over and over. And like focusing on one muscle group at a time, I just like really didn't enjoy that style of training. It felt like playing sports growing up, I was always very competitive. And I was always very kind of results oriented. And when it's the way you look, it doesn't really feel very competitive. And it's not very results oriented because it's kind of subjective. But like the way you look very state of day, definitely. So I kind of really didn't enjoy that style of training. And then also I felt like all I was doing all day was looking at the way I looked and looking at ways that could be better. And I think that's very negative. And like bodybuilding, that's kind of the way you have to train. And I felt like that was a very negative mindset to have. And it was kind of hurting myself with steam. And like I'm making all this progress in the gym, but I'm almost feeling worse about myself than when I started. Even though I felt like I had made a lot of progress towards the initial goal that I wanted. But because I'm constantly critiquing myself and I'm constantly looking at ways to improve, I wasn't developing a very positive relationship with my body. And I wouldn't say this is the reason I transitioned to parallel thing, but it was like definitely a positive side effect was I was no longer looking at the way I looked as my marker of success in the gym. I think it was definitely a positive step on my journey towards having a better relationship with my body in a way I looked. That makes sense. Yes, yeah. I guess one of my hearing is like you basically transitioned from going to the gym and optimizing kind of the way you look really towards just going to the gym because you enjoy going to the gym and like because like you are competitive and you know you enjoy powerlifting and just focusing on that instead and just kind of having that how you look kind of take a back seat. And I think we'll definitely touch on this later for sure, but like while that may have been a personal motivation of mine to kind of change my style of training, I think there's a very important lesson in that like if you're going to the gym to improve the way you look you should also be going to the gym because it's something you can enjoy. You enjoy it's something you want to be doing not exclusively to change the way you look because it's very very hard to wake up every day and go do something that you hate and stay committed to it for a very long period of time when there's no like monetary gain to it. Like you can wake up and go to a job you hate because you need to earn money, but you don't have to go to the gym like you're not going to die tomorrow if you don't go to the gym but like if you don't pay rent you're going to be out of the street right. So it's very hard to stay motivated in the gym and keep going if you really hate it and if you're only going to improve your body image and it's you actually do hate going your body image probably isn't going to improve because even if you do make changes the way you look you're not going to stick with it and it's not going to be like kind of a permanent lifestyle change and there's other ways to change the way you look without going to the gym. So I think there's like a lesson in there for everyone that you need to enjoy what you're doing and you need to have fun doing it and like with powerlifting I still get the positive effects of like you know I'm still looking way like I'm still going to put on muscle and like look stronger I may not look you know as perfectly proportioned as a bodybuilder but in the grad scheme of things if I'm way happier doing it I think it's worth it. That's fair. There's almost two aspects to it. I feel like there's one side which is like like you were saying right it's like if I feel like a lot of the reason why people find it so hard to like keep up with going to the gym is because they see it as like an obligation or like something that they're being like forced to do even if by themselves it's not something that they're actively enjoying and like I've definitely felt the same way where lots of times like it's something I feel like I didn't put as much like emphasis on before but just like realizing like oh like I go to the gym a lot less if I'm like dreading my routine I'm like dreading like the exercises I'm gonna be doing just like finding a happy balance between keeping yourself healthy and keeping yourself like mentally engaged or at least not like mentally like oppressed by like what you're putting yourself through and also the other side like you're saying where it's like if you're going to the gym because you hate how your body looks it's almost like continuing to do that and going to the gym is just feeding into that like negative aspect of yourself and as you do that like I feel like the more you try and like control like how your body looks like the more you're going to go into the minutiae of like oh there's like this tiny thing that's wrong with me that I need to fix yeah it makes sense why it wouldn't actually like improve like how you end up feeling about yourself I do think there's an important distinction where like kind of building off your point of here where if you want to make a change to your body because you think that'll improve yourself image or it's like something you want to do I think that should be encouraged but also it's important to not hyper fixate on minor insecurities even though they may not seem like minor to you it's important not like hyper fixate on the minor things about the way you look at but you may not like because it can just turn you kind of crazy trying to you know quote unquote fix them in the gym or with whatever you're doing and can definitely lead to disordered way of thinking about yourself yeah definitely I'll find nuanced line there yeah I really um I really resonated with like what you said this has got me thinking about you know having going to the gym because you like going I feel like I um I feel like it was it's it's very much felt like an obligation to me like it's very much like oh I need to make I want to make progress so I have to go to the gym uh five times a week I need to train my chest and triceps and shoulders on one day and my back and buy on the other day and I have to do a leg day and it's just like and I feel like I go and I'm just numb inside the gym for like an hour because like I don't want to be there and I'm just kind of doing the thing and um and then and then and then because of that I feel like I don't end up going as much I don't end up going five times a week so I'm always disappointed that I'm not going five times a week so every week I'm just disappointed at how many times I went to the gym and I'm just like constantly in this negative loop you know what I mean yeah I feel like yes I feel like I can't really remember the last time where it was like that wasn't a stressor in my life whereas like oh I'm not going to the gym as much as I think I have to so I definitely think that I need to change my relationship with the gym um did you ever did you do you ever hate do you ever not want to go to the gym yeah all the time um I think harping back on one of your points about you know if I don't go five days a week for an hour I feel like I'm not making any progress at all I think there's a very important thing to think about here and it's that what like the whole point of going to the gym is to like put your body under stress so that it creates a change like that's like the way building muscle works is like you put mechanical tension on the muscle do lifting weights and it like makes it grow um and like your body will respond to stressors no matter when you put it through that and like when you go to elementary school they tell you to like set goals for something like when they teach you how to set goals they don't tell you to set a goal for like oh here's my life's goal no intermediate goals like if you're gonna make your goal like okay let's say I want to lose 50 pounds your goal shouldn't just be I want to lose 50 pounds your goal should be like I want to lose my first pound and then I want to lose my first five pounds and like I want to you know hit these goals in a like relatively reasonable amount of time and then I want to lose 20 pounds 25 pounds um so there's an important thing to think about of like setting realistic expectations for yourself if you've never been at the gym before or if you struggle to go five days a week it's unrealistic to think that you're just gonna immediately start going five days a week every week for the rest of the year and like be successful at that and I think that's why a lot of people that make going to the gym their New Years Resolution fail and it's because they set too lofty a goal for themselves without having any any any intermediate goals and any plan to get themselves to a more realistic measure of that goal and the way I realize this is I was well on TikTok and there's this really cool old Hawaiian dude named Bill Maeda I think he's in his 60s but you wouldn't know that looking at him he's like shredded to the bone like super muscular um and he says the way he trains he only trains four days a week he trains exclusively outside and he does not train for more than 15 minutes a day so four days a week 15 minutes a day um I'm not a math major but I pretty sure that's only an hour of training a week most people they're one gym session lasts an hour usually um and this guy shredded and he looks like that and his whole thing is why would I force myself to work out for so long when I don't want to when I can just work out really hard for this 15 minutes and still get like really good results with consistency so I think it's very important to be to say yourself a realistic goal for going to the gym if you've never been before start with one day a week start with two days a week if you're feeling really ambitious start with three days a week and just like you're gonna get results because you've never been to the gym before and you're gonna enjoy it way more it's gonna feel way more attainable to go two days a week than it is to go five and then once you build that solid habit of okay I've been going to the gym two days a week for like quite a few weeks now then you can bump it up if you like feel like you want to so building solid habits and or like you don't that's the thing like I mean if you want to if you feel like you'll get more benefit out of going an extra day a week or you'll get more benefit out of going for a longer period of time then by all means do that if it feels attainable to you but if you feel like the three days a week you're going as enough the two days a week you're going as enough then like why change it you're happy right you're happy you're seeing progress you're feeling good about yourself isn't that the whole point to like improve your body image you have to feel good about yourself and so if you set yourself on attainable goal that makes you feel good I mean that's a win-win yeah I guess like the point is to be healthy right like you go to the gym you can go maybe like two days a week but you go have a good time you know like want like I'll go because you want to be there for two days and the rest of the days maybe like maybe play a sport or something you know yeah absolutely and yeah if you really despise going to the gym but you want to be more active because it's good for you because you want to change the way you look for whatever reason then like if you really hate to gym just don't go like go do something else you can get results on like if you want to lose weight pretty much any sport will help you lose weight including a bunch of non-sports too like if you want to like grow the size of your legs you don't have to squat you could go you know put your car in neutral and go push it up a hill like go pick up heavy rocks by a stream like there's so many ways to you can do the same walk up in New York yeah yeah exactly you know you don't have to go to the gym to get the results that you want and if you really don't like going don't go but if you do want to go you should go just set a realistic goal for yourself so that way it feels attainable and the human body responds to reward mechanisms and so if you set a realistic goal and you hit it that's a positive reward mechanism and that's going to keep building itself that's the way you build habits yeah let's feel like your whole point about like the reward structure almost like it's on the head if the only reason you're going is for some like high level goal like oh I need my body to be this way or I need like my muscles to be like this exactly way but you're not actually like if you don't at least develop like some sort of genuine enjoyment like it's going to be so much harder to be consistent about going to the gym and to have a healthy relationship with the gym and then I think another really valuable piece of advice and this really helped me when I was starting to get more serious in the gym is to write everything that you do down in terms of like your physical activity you can always like use like something like an apple watch or a Fitbit to log your workouts but I think it's really helpful to like get a composition book or like a spiral notebook or whatever however you want to write and like patting paper right what you did down each time it's helpful in the gym specifically because you can remember how much weight you lifted the previous time and you won't forget so that way you can like focus on making meaningful progress but just in general it's really nice to be able to look back at the work you've done and see the improvement you've made over time and see the consistency that you have it's a there's a level of accountability to writing your exercise down on paper that you just can't really mimic any other way and I think it's a really positive reward mechanism to look back on that old work that you've done and see the consistency that you've had and also it's a very good lesson and learning to be accepting of yourself to see when you weren't consistent how you were able to bounce back from that I think it's really motivating to see that and also gives you confidence in yourself that you know let's say you haven't been able to be the most consistent life happens for whatever reason that you're able to bounce back from that and that you're able to get back on your consistent habit again yeah like I feel like it's also very good for like challenging some of those distorted thoughts we've been talking about if you don't go five times a week like you tell yourself oh like I barely I barely been exercising I haven't been keeping up with what I should be doing till I go back and be able to see that and be like sure I may have missed a couple of days but I can see that I have like exercise decent amount I can see that there still is this like genuine improvement from like the past I feel like that can be very good for helping you keep perspective and adding one more piece to that also with the going less times maybe don't make your workouts so long a lot of people think they have to like hit like 50 sets in the gym before they can leave that that members arbitrary but like your workout doesn't have to be two hours to get your results like if you go as long as you're warming up properly everyone should be warming up so they don't get injured no matter what activity you're doing but if you give yourself 15 to 30 minutes of like really hard intentional exercise where you're really focused for that 15 to 30 minutes and you work really hard for that 15 to 30 minutes you're probably going to be more productive than if you're there for like two hours and you're not really very focused well so your workout doesn't have to be crazy long and it doesn't have to be crazy often I think the main thing is making sure that you're intentional with your time you're setting a realistic goal so you can be consistent and you're able to document your progress so that you can see the results over time yeah that makes sense I want to kind of go back to the kind of the critical voice that you mentioned we've had so basically you you kind of talked about you know having a critical voice in your head and I feel like to some extent everyone kind of has that I know I do I'm wondering how after all the progress that you've made working on having a better better body image like how is that is that voice still there and like if it is how do you how do you deal with it how do you interact with yeah that's a good question so like I think that voice will always be there for me it's kind of just part of the way I think and the way I am I think one of the things that I've been working on and I'm definitely still working progress on this is just like learning to accept that you know I will kind of always like my thoughts are always under my control but I will always have thoughts that may I wouldn't want to have like negative self-talk not liking the way I look for whatever reason and and learning to sit with your thoughts kind of acknowledge their existence acknowledge that it's not the end of the world just because you think something negative of yourself acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way and then work towards acceptance of the way you feel is really important and then kind of putting in the work both like with changing the way I look and then which is accepting that the way I look right now is okay and then I'm happy with it I think that's kind of the main battle for me and I think anyone will tell you that they're definitely a work in progress I think anyone that tells you that oh my body image is perfect is probably lying and if it is somehow perfect they should probably still be working on it because things don't always stay like that forever so yeah I think just trying to accept who you are and what you are right now and be happy with that is kind of the most important battle mentally for a lot of people including myself yeah I mean I feel like one thing that's important to emphasize is like I think it's important to separate like the gym and the valuable aspects you can get out of that from the negative self-image that can lead people to the gym in the first place so what sort of like you were saying Garrett like being able to having a healthier relationship to the gym going to the to improve your health to take care of your body and even afterwards maybe like you like how you look being more muscular or more fit but at the same time not using that to fuel that negative self-image that can drive people to the gym in the first place not letting that feed into those negative thoughts and those critical thoughts which tell you that like oh I need to do this in order to have a good body or I need to do this in order to be happy with the body that you have I think that it's important to like to be able to separate that desire to improve yourself from the idea that because of that you need to hate where you are right now yeah that's definitely a really good point I think it's an example of separating those two things that I think of when you said that is the concept of fat shaming there's a lot of people that will wrongly say that fat shaming is good because it'll motivate someone to lose weight that shame they feel will allow them to bring about what they perceive as a positive change of someone losing weight and I think that really that way of thinking really ignores the issue at hand and the issue at hand is that well maybe someone may want to make a change to better their health by losing weight the way to get there is not through negative self-talk it's through positive self-talk and a positive encouragement like you're stuck in the body that you have right now and if you're not capable of loving that body you're never going to be capable of loving the body that you're able to turn into so that shame mechanism doesn't really work because the self-image will be poor regardless yeah so if people want to make a change in order to lose weight you have to give them positive reinforcement and positive encouragement and not negative enforcement yeah definitely yeah it's pretty well established like through like studies and stuff that like a lot of what fuels like poor eating habits and like yeah just like weight gain is like problems like like emotional like underlying emotional issues and when you like shame someone for being overweight and for having like what they see as a bad body if you shame someone for that that's just going to cause them to like go eat even more and like treat their body in an unhealthy way even more because that's how they've like yeah that's how they deal with those problems and it just makes them worse and even if they're like specific cases where people improve because of that stuff yeah like you're saying like that doesn't change the fact that they're gonna have like a negative image of their body and it can even lead to unhealthy patterns in other ways right like that's what causes people to get eating disorders like anorexia internalizing that idea to such an extent where it's like yeah they're no longer overweight but it's not that they're getting to a healthier place it's just replacing the problem with another problem and to speak personally for a minute like I was definitely one of those people like like I was saying like I grew up like pretty overweight and um yeah I would always like hate on myself like I would hate how my body looked and it actually did drive me like in high school to lose like 30 pounds or something because I was finally so unhappy with how I looked that yeah like it finally pushed me to like maintain my weight and diet and stuff but afterwards like it didn't really make me any happier and looking back at it it's like I lost all that weight but I was still thinking like oh I just need to lose like this much more weight and then I'll be in a good place and I won't care about my weight anymore and it didn't stop me from like disliking how I looked and hating like how my body looked and over the pandemic um I actually gained back like 40 or 50 pounds and yeah I feel like like it's like it sort of put into perspective for me like how little like those sorts of changes actually impacted like how I saw myself and like in a or let me put it better way like it it really put into like perspective like how little of like myself worth actually improved like by making those changes to my body like and it really like yeah and the only thing that's really gotten me to a place where I'm happy with myself is like working on myself like mentally and like yeah like working on that like mental aspect the self-hatred that negative voice and because of that like I feel like I have even like health wise like a more healthy relationship to my body like I feel more motivated to go to the gym to exercise to like go out and like explore like hobbies that I like like hiking and stuff or like yeah yeah like that's definitely something that resonates with me a lot still like like I said like I still haven't unpacked a lot of this um like it's still definitely something that I'm struggling with yeah everything you guys have been saying has been like really resonating with my experience and like giving me a new way of thinking about these things and I think that leads it to like another point of like if you think that shaming works towards like helping someone lose weight it kind of ignores that like there can be other causes of like weight gain that aren't overeating medication hormone changes genetics environmental factors can all play a role and how heavy you are and how much weight you what weight you're at and how much fat you're you hold um and shaming someone who you just view as overweight because you think they eat too much kind of just is very reductive it ignores the issue and then kind of harping on one of your points is that even if there's like a one in a million chance that the shame does work the whole point is to get someone to a place where they feel happy with the way they are right now and they're comfortable and their skin and the way they look and then if they're comfortable in their skin and the way they look and they want to make a change then that's a positive change but it's a negative change there's someone hates the way they look and wants to make a change and so they make that change like that that's not a positive change it's like that's a negative change I don't think that's a necessarily a good thing to encourage or praise so just the whole the whole shaming idea just really doesn't is kind of ignoring reality it's also very um ego-tistical you know what I mean because it's like it's I was just thinking that fat shaming is one thing and then like well also like also the opposite red like oh you don't eat enough like you should eat more if you're too skinny oh yeah like both of those things it's just like oh I have life figured out and this is how you're supposed to live it and like kind of telling someone else what to do where yeah they have they probably have so many other things going on I feel like there's a certain sense here of kind of ignoring the fact that like everyone is trying their best you know what I mean like everyone is playing the same like game everyone is going through life they're all doing what they think is best for them so shouldn't really be going and in and telling someone what to do you know like um especially in a way that's like oh yeah you should you should eat more you should eat less like it's uh it's very reductive and there's no there's no scenario in which it it uh someone like takes it in the correct in a positive way yeah this is also like if what you're focusing on is just like oh this person should make changes with their life like why are you making them feel bad about themselves like what's the point of that like I very much do you feel like it's just a way of feeling better than someone like oh you have this problem that I don't have so I'm gonna make you feel like shit for having this problem when it's like everyone has their own problems like obviously like the person who's like doing the bullying isn't perfect either it's just fundamentally like a way of feeling better than the other person one of my least favorite genres content on the internet is so one sees a fat person working out in the gym and then records them to make fun of them on the internet it's like you you you can in one breath say you want people to make a change and then in the next breath make fun of someone for trying to make that change like it's just so mind boggling to me this person is trying to improve their life let's laugh have you guys see there's more content nowadays that's like hey guys we need to bring back bullying oh yeah what are you talking about oh yes we are we all know that the past was just the bastion of like more out of like best outcomes we clearly never made improvements yes what's like how do we solve today's society's problems more bullying that's the best you can think of bruh I want to I want to ask though like in the I know I feel like as a society I think we're definitely better about these things than we were a number of years ago I think there's definitely like over time less and less emphasis on I mean there still is but like not at least like not as toxic like oh you have to go work out you have to look a certain way yeah um they're definitely like a change is I feel like for for men the change has been very slow and like kind of hidden and I think it I think we don't talk about it enough yeah quite honestly and I think we need to and that will lead to more change but I'm just curious like in in the gym community like in let's say like the power lifting community or um you know people who work out enthusiastically because they're passionate about it like how what is that like like what what are conversations like are there is it like collectively like what is the stance on like why you should do this or like how you should look so one of the things I really like about powerlifting is how inclusive it is like at least when I was when I went to my very first powerlifting gym I was shocked at how friendly and inclusive and helpful everyone was like the strongest people and those gyms are usually the nicest and the most humble whereas when you maybe go to like some random public gym a lot of the strong people there just kind of give off this aura of insecurity like trying to be better than the people around them or like like they want to feel better than the people around them so they try to make themselves look better than the people around them um there's very little of that ego and powerlifting I think because the sport is so humbling because there's almost always someone stronger than you so no matter how strong you are there's almost always someone above your level like quite significantly so I think it's actually a really positive environment and I would encourage people to try out the sport because of that um but I think in the gym community overall we need to adopt more of the mindset that like new people starting out need positive mentors to look up to and positive role models and just people to be nice to them and help them out and not a and it's very important to not come across as I know more than you when you're helping someone out like I think it's probably not advisable to give someone like unsolicited advice in the gym because that can come across very whole year than now like like like I know more than you um so just like try to be nice and helpful when engaged um and just be like a like a positive role model for others is I think something that everyone should be striving towards and I think something that the powerlifting community does well that the broader gym community should try to adopt and then one other thing sorry to uh that I that I just thought about is um like the powerlifting gym that I go to um I love their t-shirts their t-shirts say little fit little fat on it which I just think is like it's such a good mindset to have like like you know kind of kind of making fun of yourself in a way but in a way that's you know just silly and self accepting and honest with yourself I think more people need to be willing to talk about themselves like that and you know maybe make fun of themselves a little bit but in a way that's positive and outlifting and encouraging as opposed to negative and self-destructive yeah definitely like there's a happy aspect about being able to laugh about your flaws versus like like yeah like just attacking yourself mm-hmm yeah I'm gonna see like what you're saying about like the powerlifting community versus the more general like gym community is very related to what we've been talking about with mindset because it's like if you're going into something like powerlifting you're doing that because of that love of the sport right it's because you're getting that enjoyment out of it so it's like there's like just an openness to anyone who has that passion right versus like for a lot of people going to the gym I feel like if it is coming from like a negative place and from a negative body image like that can cause people to become like sort of like bullies because it's like oh like it because it's like if you feed into the idea that like I have to look like fit I have to look muscular in order to have like a good body image then it's like so easy to look down at other people and be like oh you haven't put in the effort so I'm gonna like see you as less or like look down on you for not having like that you like you don't have the right to like have self-worth because you're not like putting in like that effort to be like have an ideal body or like to be muscular definitely and like thinking about the reasons why someone would go to a powerlifting gym versus the reason someone would go to like just some general public commercial gym are so different and like the people that go to a powerlifting gym they're always really expensive and usually like they're not a chain so you have to go to that like one gym that you're paying money to go to and like the reason someone would do that is because they're really passionate about it and tone that's really passionate about something probably enjoys it versus someone that may go to like you know like 24 hour fitness or anything so whatever gym may not necessarily be super passionate about going to the gym and I don't want to discourage people from trying to go to the gym especially if you haven't tried it before because I think it can be really fun and it's like a really positive activity to do but I think it's important that you know if you don't have that passion or like that drive to go to the gym like find something active that you are passionate about like just like go outside do a sport like I mean there's so many other activities and ways to be active to like make positive changes to your health like don't force yourself to go to that you know sweaty poorly lit building that you hate going to and you spend a bunch of money on every week like going for a run is free like going for a walk is free like go high you know by using bike and bike list and go cycling go surf yeah that's like I mean I know we live in California like I mean so many people would die to live on the coast like take advantage of it go outside have fun do something you like doing get a dog absolutely although I don't know if that's good advice for everyone I'm sure something great yes free listener by dogs right now to improve your get a job and and make them chase your yeah low key not even wrong though because like there's so many people who say like oh like I got like having my dog like forces me to stay physically active because it's like this motherfucker isn't going to stay inside all day so I can and I think there's like something to be said there of like having accountability is important like if you're gonna set goals for yourself I think it's important that you tell people that you trust around you obviously people that are like really your friend like you know someone in your family that you trust like a really close friend like tell people that you trust that will like hold you account not hold you accountable in the sense that like text you every day hey did you go to the gym but like someone that like provides some reality and grounding to the goals that you're setting I think is important like making those goals somewhat public in the sense that like you know someone else knows about them I think it's a really positive thing to motivate you to stay on track and build positive habits definitely like being open about it like what you're doing and and I almost feel like what we were saying about like enjoying like what you're doing and enjoying like physical activities like I mean that can be one way of having that right if you have like a social group that like goes to the gym and like that doesn't all together like that can be one way of enjoying it like what we were even saying with like a pet like that's another way that you're enjoying the physical activity like spending this time with this animal and that's what ends up like motivating you. Mm-hmm and like don't be afraid to talk to people like I mean another gym is not the most like social public place but like yeah if you have the opportunity to like talk to someone that you think might be nice and like make a friend like do it like having a friend in the gym is only like a positive thing like it'll just give you another reason to come because you like have a friend there that you want to talk to and like you know may the person that you talk to didn't want to talk back to you or you know isn't gonna be your friend but like don't have to discourage you from trying it with like the next person like obviously don't go like rip someone's headphones off and start talking to them but like just be friendly be nice like I mean I'm kind of introverted but like try to be social and like mean new people like it'll make the gym a more positive experience for you for sure. Yeah that's the thing it just it's I feel like my current relationship with the gym it just it feels like such a soulless place it feels like a yeah it feels empty of meaning and soul and soul really just like devoid of meaningful connection you know yeah and so what you're saying is very like I mean it's scary though like you know talking to talking to stranger isn't easy especially in like a place that isn't intended to be like a social environment like talking to a stranger's probably a lot easier at like you know like a bar that it is at the gym but I mean everyone's there for the same reason relatively and like you shouldn't be embarrassed about being new or you know being there for a long time like there's nothing to be embarrassed about like everyone's there for the same reason so be friendly and be nice and I'm sure people will be friendly and nice back to you and if they're not call them out on it like I mean that's not acceptable for someone to be to you I would hope you would stand up for yourself you know just in general I think us like guys need to talk a lot more about not guys just everyone needs to talk a lot more about like where they are what their relationship with the gym is because honestly I'll be very frank like I don't think I've talked about this what my relationship with the gym is outside of this conversation and leading up to this podcast episode and just from doing that I feel like I've learned so much so many things gotten perspective from both of you and I can already feel a little bit lighter you know when it comes to my relationship with the gym and so I really want to encourage everyone to talk about where they are in terms of their body image how they're feeling with their relationship is with their body and with the gym with their friends yeah fundamentally like for like all of this stuff like I'd say like most issues people have I feel like that's really like the clincher like being open like being able to have people that you can have that sort of connection with and like talk to yeah just open up about your experiences I feel like it's such an isolating experience going through all that yeah but the crazy thing is everyone has dealt with the same like everything Eric has said I feel like I've thought about at some point you know and same with you here I feel like we've all like yeah no those the same thoughts have entered our ads we've dealt with it in different ways some people have made more progress than others I feel like if we come by in all of our experiences everyone would benefit yeah no 100% absolutely and like I think and important thing to think about is like I know a lot of people are really afraid to be open with people because you know maybe they've had a negative experience with it in the past so they're worried they're gonna have a negative experience at the in the future but there's like only two ways that conversation can go it can either go positively which like great you feel better by yourself or if you go negatively in which case if the conversation you have with someone around the way you look and the way you feel about the way you look goes negatively doesn't that tell you more about the other person than it does yourself like you're being open and honest and the other person is demeaning you or talking negatively about you like that says more about them than you so like don't be afraid of that conversation going negatively because all that should do is inform you that you probably don't have a good friend and maybe you should be another one or confide in someone else yeah why would you want someone around you who you can't be open with and that you can't open up to yeah I think it's important to like evaluate the influences in your life and the people around you and like if you really don't feel comfortable around them being yourself and part of being yourself is being honest and open with others then you should reevaluate those people and like making new friends is scary but like don't be afraid to try like yeah like the worst answer you can probably get from someone is like no and then just try to give someone else yeah like even if you try having that conversation it's negative and you have to cut that person out of your life it's like that person was always like the friendship you had was always negative right like even if it doesn't get in the moment like that's always something that can only like go in a positive direction even if it ends up with you saying like you know like this isn't the kind of person I want to be around this isn't the kind of person who's helping me like they're just gonna like drag my life down and oftentimes someone who would speak negatively about you like that probably has deep set issues of their own yeah that they're not being honest about and not working on yeah it's often very self-reflective in that manner yeah there's a saying that I love that's what Joe says about Mary says more about Joe than Mary like what people say about other people is more reflection of who they are than anything true about hooking Joe yeah hate that guy had to cut him out of my life top day Joe's I hear top three Joe's first first one was that came to my mind was Joe Biden Joe Biden then Joe Biden and then Joe Rogan those are the only three Joe's that come to mind and they're all Joe mama being firmly underrated in this conversation in shambles right now no mama we got my top they got trader Joe bro can't really compete with trader Joe high highest highest grocery sales per footage per square footage of any chain grocery store are you fucking kidding me that's way really yes that's crazy and they have those that are following and they have the least verite for any

don't they don't put people don't people want less off anyways this is a yeah entirely conversation for a completely different episode but people don't want options anyways wait we need the rest of your top three top three hot night Joe oh shit okay yeah hot night um yes my friend Joe comes up once every month or a couple months somehow I don't know why but it shows up somewhere I'm gonna have to throw in one of my favorite actors of all time Joe Pesci oh I love that man so elite mobster just just such a good mobster and then another one of my favorite basketball players based purely off place that I saw Joe Johnson hope someone will sit here Joe Johnson are pretty theaters you know like that's a forgotten man I was gonna say I will keep his name alive I'm pretty Joe Joe Pesci actually has like mob affiliations like at least with its family or something it's kind of like real IRL yeah yeah that's so cool yeah yeah I heard some like I don't know I was watching some youtube video like mobsters talking about like different actors who played like like mob members and he's like Joe Pesci is the one who definitely like like seems like they know it like for real that's so cool yeah gained even more respect from the end today well we've had some good conversation I think I think I do want to kind of switch gears a little bit and talk a bit more about like I want to talk a little bit more about that process of getting a positive body image because I feel like it's really difficult especially with media and the media that we consume I think from a very young age we're taught that this these are certain there are certain ideal ways to look for social status for having the life that you want having respect love affection so there's that and there's like you know comparison I feel like there's always like I can't tell you how many times throughout my life I've had this thought it was like man I wish I looked like that I wish I just had that body you know what I mean and just the process of kind of ignore I don't know if ignoring them is the right word but looking beyond it looking internally yeah I just I just want I want to talk about that a little bit especially now with the rise of fitness influencers it's like a whole different ballgame like even if you are in the gym and working out you you might in your following any of these people it seems like a cesspool honestly my personal advice to someone like starting out in the gym or like it was negatively impacted by like the content they see online is like I really think you should like unfollow all fitness influencers um like your social media like unless the content is really really educational like teaching you how to like do something yeah um or you you personally find it very motivating and very like positive I really think you should like just not engage with that content I don't think it's like positive for your mental health to like constantly see people that you're comparing yourself to that have like the ideal image that you want to look because like and it's just not realistic like you don't walk around every day and see people like that um and it can give you like a very distorted perception of reality um like like you walk out on the street you don't see a bunch of fitness influencers you just see like everyday people yeah I guess like fitness influencers one thing but also like just you know actors and like I mean media that we consider I think like an important thing to think about is that like every single person is probably comparing themselves to someone else and saying like oh I wish I look like that or I wish I had XYZ feature um like even the most famous person you know or the person you're comparing yourself to does that to other people so everyone has their own insecurities and I mean there's the famous saying like comparison is the thief of joy but it's also the thief of progress in your body image it's like impossible to stop comparing yourself to others it's important to be mindful like actively mindful of when you're doing it and to try and not let those and to try and recognize that comparing yourself to others is usually a negative thought and try and accept that you're doing it and work towards improving your thought patterns about yourself um I think in general with like steps to improve your body image it always comes back to like self-acceptance and the only way to accept yourself is to get to the root cause of why you have negative self-image or what aspects of your self-image are negative what the root cause of that is and then how you can address that going forward in your life and it's not going to be like a binary like oh you know I'm insecure about this because of this it's going to be kind of broad in general or maybe a collection of things or maybe a specific traumatic incident but it's important to try and think about those root causes in your life and it's not going to be easy like any process of introspection and self-reflection is difficult but over time recognize that and try and work towards solutions for yourself yeah one thing that helps for me too at least like especially for celebrities is um I feel like understanding like sort of like looking behind the scenes and see realizing like how much in that is like manufactured like especially as someone who's like very much into like filmmaking and stuff it's like for example like for actors to look good on screen they literally won't drink water for like 24 to 36 hours just for like that good looking shot of them muscular and it's like if you look at other shots of them like after that time it's like to to realize how big of a change that was and to see them within more normal body like it really puts into perspective like okay like this isn't something like like like you were saying Garrett um it's not like these people are just like that like going down the street every day right uh it's like that is something like very specifically manufactured and that is literally impossible to have like physically 24-7 like I feel like like yeah like seeing those beside behind the scenes photos like seeing those celebrities in like more normal context can really help um at least for me like to challenge some of those that's because yeah like it just gives you that perspective that like okay like this isn't like everyday life this is like normal this is something that takes a lot of effort that my photo shot like yeah a great one that goes into is um the mister olympia champion so like the the like world championships of bodybuilding is uh this thing's crisp bumpstead um here's a big youtube channel where he like takes you behind the scenes of the olympia competition and like the days leading up to it um and then the actual day of and it just goes to show you like how unnatural it is for someone's body to look like that and to compare yourself to that and think that you're gonna get to looking like that it's just like like you watch this man like suffer for like days on days and like torture himself to like look like this and even he sells it himself like like I hate I hate this right now like I want to stop um so like seeing that and then that being your comparison point it's just like like why would you put those thoughts in your head right like that it's not realistic that's not reality that's not what someone looks like on their day to day so try not to compare yourself to that and you know it's easier said than done but it's something you should be actively mindful of and thinking about when you're consuming content online is like be mindful about how it may be impacting yourself in image and yourself worth and how much comparison you're actually doing I think something there to think about is like yet the real is everything comes out of cost we put certain things on pedestals certain things that are glorified by media and just like the society that we live in so for example that person who's like a really ripped person right with like you know a great v shape and you know they have that v tape are going down into their thighs and you know it comes out of cost you know they they deprive themselves of certain things you know they probably didn't weren't able to eat the food that they wanted to for a really long time maybe they lived on chicken broccoli and rice maybe they drank four protein shakes a day maybe and maybe they spent like two hours in the gym every single day maybe they took steroids which will impact their you know life later on kind of to realize everyone is like a hundred percent of a person you have to see what you value right do I value being able to have a cookie every other day something sweet like something that makes you feel happy do you value that over one percent less body fat than you're at right now yeah like what do you value as a person if you're gonna put in if you're gonna value that like glorified look over everything else then you're gonna be depressed you know another good thing to think about is like a fitness influencer their job is to look like that like date literally that is their livelihood that's how they make money right so I wouldn't look at like an astrophysicist for NASA or like a rocket scientist and say like oh I'm sure I know how to make rockets as good as they do I mean I'm not a rocket scientist so like why would I know how to make rockets as good as they do so like why should I look at a fitness influencer whose job it is to look like a fitness influencer and say like oh I should be looking like that like no you shouldn't like they they spend all day every day trying to look like that and they're probably miserable doing it like you shouldn't look like that that's not realistic that's not the way you should look or like the way you should be so don't compare yourself to someone that is doing something that you can't even do even if you wanted to like I almost feel like like we're saying about like mindfulness right it's about like understanding that as like a choice that like people like where it's like yeah like if you like to understand that that's not some sort of like body someone is just like granted or like gifted from the heavens but it's something where it's like they're intentionally putting in this choice to put in that much time and it's like maybe based like like you're saying like for like 99.99% of people like they literally don't have that time they literally can't make that choice and just be okay with like that life you have to be able to accept yourself in your limitations and like yeah to understand like also like the cost that would come with pursuing that sort of like so like yeah yeah yeah so you can become comfortable with like yourself and like with the choices and also like yeah to achieve those results require so much time and effort and a lot of people will see or like perceive that they can get shortcuts to that and attempt them and I think it's very important to transfer people away from those shortcuts sometimes being like performance enhancing drugs like every single one is really bad for you and you shouldn't do it like every single performance enhancing drug is illegal and professional sports for a reason it's because it's like awful for your health and like if the leagues could sponsor performance enhancing drugs of course they would because it would make their athletes like way better and it make the sport more entertaining but it's like literally awful for people's health so they can't like knowingly let people take something that's like awful for them and then another one is like people will like get themselves into eating disorders looking at like people online that they want to look like in an effort to try and lose weight to look like them it's very important to have a positive relationship with the food you eat and to view eating as a positive thing and not a negative thing obviously eating disorders are horrible for you and I wouldn't want anyone to develop one but like it's important to be cognizant that you can develop eating disorders through over a obsession with the media that you can swim online or compare some to others eating disorders are literally the most fatal like mental health disorder you can have it's important to emphasize like how damaging and destructive something like that can be absolutely the part where you said they can't promote performance and enhancing drugs because they're bad for you I was just thinking like yeah like Coca-Cola like the word with you or like tobacco would like to have more word with you like like it's so like the NBA would love everyone to be on performance enhancing drugs like players jumping higher and doing cooler dunks and like not being able to get injured like wouldn't that be sick for the NBA like of course they would want that it would drive ratings through the roof but like if it's killing their players like they're gonna get sued to the ground so they obviously can't promote it as I was thinking like what you were saying about like not getting injured unperformance enhancing drugs it's like well they are getting injured just not on the court yeah just later on yeah yeah everything's got a class yeah I guess like the only thing with like relationship with the women is it's like a it can be a big motivating factor for why people go to the gym in the first place like the comments there you type you see is like someone gets their heart broken by a girl that they really liked or a guy that they really liked and then they feel like shit about themselves and they need a place to channel those negative emotions so they go to the gym and they go really hard and then they completely change the way they look like that's like a common trope so it's important to understand that like those feelings are negative and it's good to have a negative positive channel for your negative emotions but it's important to not let your relationship with the gym become purely about channeling negative emotions because I don't think that's a very healthy way to live and where like something you do every day is just purely based on negative emotion right yeah another thing is like a lot of people go to the gym as a way to get a body that they feel will impress women that's so backwards for a number of reasons one like women are way more impressed with who you are as a person than the way you look as I think most people are like people just want someone who's like confident in who they are and the way they look and the type of person they are and you know if going to the gym helps you become more confident person than by all means go but don't think that going to the gym and getting muscles it's gonna entitle you to women or allow you to get women that you otherwise wouldn't have gotten before because that's you're setting yourself up for failure and it's also a very objectifying way to think about relationships and other people yourself and women no you're sure like I mean the the thing there is like hey like would you rather be friends with someone who is rip or just a good person yeah and just like you know more comfortable with themselves and nice to you and just interesting and you know confident in their own way not toxic yeah I feel like I mean got like this a whole this a whole episode but but it comes it kind of comes back to the whole notion of like oh women are kind of these different species almost it was like no they're all just people like if you go on TikTok and you find like a really attractive woman who's dating like a guy with a dad bod and you look in the comment section it's all people just like absolutely hating on the guy and it's like do you not realize that you hating on that guy is the reason a girl like that wouldn't want to be with you or any girl wouldn't want to be with you it's because yeah such a negative image of yourself and of others that you think like relationships are transactional like that it's like that dude's probably like funny and a really good person and like really nice to hang around and very confident in himself and that's why she likes him and if you apply that to yourself wouldn't matter what you would look like people people are attracted to confidence and like authenticity if you're like confident and authentically yourself and comfortable with who you are people are gonna like that yeah it's like they tell them like these people tell themselves that like oh women are shallow and just like muscular men and as soon as someone disproves that they just get insanely like angry and hateful because they he's totally rich yeah exactly they need to find excuses and find some way to like just find the wrong way of thinking in their own head yeah I mean a lot of what we're talking about is very much rooted in like that toxic like masculinity like even when it comes down to I feel like when you were saying about like got I mean like it applies to everyone but I feel like it does this play especially for guys like they I feel like we are so let's open about like how we're feeling and like being open and honest about I mean toxic masculinity just reeks of insecurity and insecurity is just negative body image so I think one positive thing about people working to improve their body image is it would hopefully lessen the amount of toxic masculinity in the world and that the the thing the earlier thing you said about like oh the trope of guy going through a breakup and then going to the gym as an outlet for their negative emotions like dude 100 percent like I've seen so many I've seen so many real that will show like oh some guy went through a breakup and it'll just be some other dude like inviting him like he'd come to the gym and it'll just be like a dumbbell is like here come come come come you can join us and people need to realize there's other ways to channel that like negative image yeah like you don't have to go to the gym and kind of develop this unhealthy relationship with the gym like that's not the only way also those on how those negative emotions will heal over time and if that's your only motivator for going then you're gonna lose motivation very quickly so that's that's just even another motivating factor are you going to the gym to deal with your negative emotions or your negative emotions forcing you to go to the gym you need to make sure you're going for the right reasons so real to I when I when I first went through my breakup I I went to the gym twice a day I want to say like a month yeah and then like there was there's a month where I just didn't go at all like a breakup can be such a positive time in terms of like self growth like make a lot of like introspective realizations about yourself during that time but it's really important to realize that that self-growth should be positive and like based around positive thoughts those close to negative thoughts yeah 100 percent oh what I wait I have one more point I wanted to add drink water people need to drink more water that it's like my number one piece of advice to like every single person on planet earth is like drink more water I drink a gallon of water a day and ever since I started doing that I wake up with more energy my skin cleared up my focus is so much better like I didn't even realize it but I have like a lot of like brain fog that I just kind of existed with for a really long time and then I started drinking more water and I realized like oh shit I don't have to like like I don't have to feel like this all the time like drinking more water has so many positive health benefits for you and so many people don't get enough water throughout the day by yourself a big water bottle preferably like if you can just get all your water in like one container throughout the day that's really easy because then you just finish it and you're done and that might be kind of inconvenient like get yourself the biggest container that you can carry around and just like polish it dude it's so good for you what I can't emphasize how good water is for your physical and mental and emotional health like everything about your life will improve if you drink more water I'm ordering a gallon water bottle and you'll have you will have to pee do it for like like a lot for like the first like two three weeks when you start increasing your water and take but that will go away you'll start going to the bathroom a regular amount too also a lot of times when you're hungry you're actually just dehydrated if you're trying to lose weight and if you're and if you're thirsty you're already dehydrated you should be drinking before you get thirsty yeah drink water guys if you didn't take anything else away from this episode drink more water if you drink more water we'll consider this episode is absolutely my number one piece of advice fuck the last two hours all right well this was a great conversation I think we hit a lot of really good topics I think in summary really examine the relationship you have with your body and take steps to improve that body image not by going to the gym but I'll just try to deal with that in isolation and with the gym again do the same thing examine the relationship you have with the gym if it's negative if you hate going it's time for a change you know change how you approach your health do things that make you feel good about doing them set smaller goals drink more water uh any other any other takeaways you guys want to get I feel like that's pretty much thank you at the moment thanks thank you guys y'all could just listen to that instead yeah a TLDR little quick notes that'll listen to you maybe it's three it's a ramble for two hours this is the day of summarizing real quick again like thank you guys for listening reiterating

the week garrick okay so my art pick of the week is it's actually not one painting it's a series of paintings it's called the black paintings it's by my favorite painter Francis gogoya he was a painter in the late 17 early 1800s and basically he had retired to this house outside of Madrid his own country is Spain he was he was already deaf because he was suffering from an illness that he developed in his 40s and then he basically retreated to this house and kind of became a hermit and started going crazy and he was already a really talented painter and during that time like politically Spain was like undergoing a lot of unrest and change and they were just coming off like the Napoleonic Wars and so he had like a lot of feelings about that and he was just kind of getting like really terrified and paranoid and hysteric and his paintings are like kind of like one of the coolest insights into like the decay of the mind I've ever seen basically he did all of them using oil paint directly on the walls of his house so it's kind of like a crazy psychotic person scribbling on their walls but the paintings are really beautiful and they've all been basically removed from his walls and put in this one this one museum in Spain highly recommend checking them out they're kind of horrific but also really really cool and the art is just like gorgeous that's the one uh saturday night yes that's probably the most famous one of them but there there's a whole series of them yeah they basically covered the entire walls of his house with it yeah they're insane wow what I got out of this was that I'm a noob when it comes to paintings I don't know anything about paintings take some art history bro educate yourself yeah um yes I feel very uneducated right now me an intellectual isn't it isn't an intellectual thing to realize that you're I think I think being able to oh yeah you don't know something is the smartest thing you can do yeah I feel like saying me an intellectual is like the person that intellectuals so I mean yeah it was meant to be a joke fuck all y'all David what about you your piece of the wig you like my art pic of the week is I I've been I want to share this this underground producer that I've been listening to um this is gonna be Taiman Polar some shit isn't it no it's not true it's not Taiman Polar his name is Karel got the sauce this very underground producer his production is fresh it's full it's fun it's got this energy he's very new I really like a stuff go check him out on Spotify um has he collabed with any big artists I don't think so oh damn so you're you really putting this really going through the weeds right now um but this one producer has really caught my eye I wanted to share if you're looking for a specific song to listen to I'll put a link but the one prayers up I think was one of my favorites I think I think I think I think it's fresh I think it's this part of the reason I think I've been falling off of hip hop a little bit recently as just it feels like a lot of the same stuff at least a lot of the songs that are in popular popular pop culture I've been looking for more interesting things in this cut my eye I'm so excited to tell my friends way that I totally discovered him on my own and I was a day one fan oh yeah yeah um we're deleting this podcast episode so there's no evidence we you told us also for complete clarity I know this person from beforehand is not someone that I discovered you know out on the streets uh I would college with this person he's a great guy but go listen to his music it's it's really good um his tagline again is carol got this house I'm gonna put a link okay I that makes so much sense because I was wondering like something about your delivery in your face makes me feel like I'm being pranked right now I was so obsessed he's plugging his boy hey respect respect to the world all right I hear your turn all right um so I'm gonna share with y'all this completely unknown underground gem film that I watched the other day for the second time grand Budapest Hotel uh okay I mean yes I know it's not actually underground but uh yeah I mean I watched it again for the second time and I think I loved it even more than the first time like I yeah that's one of my favorite films ever and I just feel like it's like I mean this cinematographer to be is amazing like I also feel like the story this time like there's a lot more like political metaphor and like political like satire going on that I didn't catch the last time so that was really cool um yeah and it's just like one of those films where like my girlfriends family friends came to visit um so they were they just put it on because some of them hadn't seen it before and I wasn't even expecting to watch or anything I was expecting to like go to the other room and do my own thing and I just sat down and watched the whole thing like I was instantly hooked from the beginning so yeah love the film who's the director what's Anderson yeah it's one of the less yeah yeah it's my I really like it a lot because I feel like his style actually works in that film where it's like it fits what the story is going for and like what it's alluding to so yeah I actually haven't seen that movie but I have seen well I was at a restaurant one time and the movie was playing on the TV with no volume so I've seen a couple scenes with no volume and I can't can attest that cinematography is beautiful I can vouch for you there I would recommend you watch it again with the volume because there's so much like comedy that comes from like the dialogue and just oh yeah I didn't actually watch a movie one I feel like Dave Patel is in every us Anderson movie West Anderson uses like the same five actors over and over again so one of his things got you fire okay hey that that wraps it up thank you guys peace yeah great talk Garrett thanks for yeah absolutely thank you guys so much for having me honored to be the first guest on the show it was a lot of fun thank you
