 Hey everyone, welcome to Pineapple Plant Rotation. I'm Dave. I'm here. And we're just a couple of 23 year olds trying to figure out life and start conversations. We want to bring to light different issues that people face and talk about them and our own experiences about them. And not necessarily giving answers because we're not mental health experts, but giving perspectives and encouraging people to start asking questions in a conversation. Yeah, before we get into all of that though, probably good to give a three-four-time speech of us since the y'all don't know who we are. Yeah, like I said, I'm here. I'm 23. Like my, like Dave, I'm already says. Yeah, I graduated from college in Newsy Berkeley in 2021. Yeah, I'm a software engineer. Like a lot of people in Seattle. And yeah, other than that, terms of interest, I'd say I'm very into stuff like art, philosophy, pretentious intellectualship like that. Yeah, those are the big ones that come to mind. And yeah, so again, I'm Dave. I am also 23. I also work in tech, software engineer up here in Seattle. I graduated from UCLA in 2021. Interest, I like reading, I like cooking, I like music. I'm trying to get into music production. All kinds of creative stuff, I also really like sports. Which one specifically? Which sports? Top three sports. Top three sports. Soccer? Soccer is definitely, I should say, football. But soccer, the angry war, and basketball. And let's say, what's my third? Right now, I'm going to say pickleball. Pickleball. It's been playing and I really enjoy it. I think it's a lot of fun. And if you ever see like, both people playing in the park, like, you can go play with them because they'll probably kick your ass. Like, they're really good at speaking from experience. Yep, speaking from experience. So how do we know each other here? Um, it all goes back to chemistry. Chemistry? That's when we first met each other, right? Pengrade, Ken? High school. 11 grade. 11 grade. Junior year, high school. That's right. And we're supposed to room together at UCLA. And last minute, I hear you decided to switch to Berkeley. That is the most generous way. Oh, yeah. Not, oh, I went to UCLA and they told me about Philly Glass. They would have sent me. So kind of left for that option, but it worked out in the end. We met back up in Seattle and now we're living together here. Yeah. So like we said earlier, we were going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, oh, I'm wondering and so like we said earlier, we're really just trying to dive into different experiences, specifically in relations with mental health. And I think one that's very ubiquitous, culturally, something that I guess we touch on and we see a lot, but not necessarily that we dive into is, uh, breakups. And the sort of emotionally fact that breakups can have on you. Yeah, I think breakups are there's so much breakups are such a powerful experience that people go through and there's so much art that comes out of it like there's so many books there's so many songs movies that are built on that feeling and kind of are made to evoke that feeling and make us emotional but surprisingly not that much like there isn't that much they're not talked about a lot in general culture yeah not a very easy conversation to start with yeah like get open up I guess all right so they've since you just went through a breakup why don't you start off by telling us a bit about what happened yeah um I went through a breakup recently a couple months ago it uh we had met in college and had four really amazing years together and um you know we went through so much like we went through a pandemic major life moments like we graduated started work but ultimately we both had been dating for quite a while like even before a relationship and hadn't really had time to be single and I think the relationship we had was really amazing it I mean to me it definitely feels like a right person wrong time situation it's funny like I would always hear this um phrase that is used in like movies and shows and books and stuff there's like sometimes like to love means to let go and um yeah and so that's what kind of happened in this situation yeah so what like what was like when that happened I mean like you said like you guys were together for four years like something like that like must have definitely been like a shock like how is what was your initial reaction in the moment um it it did I mean we we had some conversations leading up to it that had maybe pointed in that direction um but it I guess it doesn't really matter because it it did still hit me like a trimmer I think when it happened I my immediate response was to start journaling like a bad man like just trying to help me go through me yeah I know just trying to make sense of everything and you know like writing down okay like okay I got this like what am I gonna do how am I like I need this like I definitely I was definitely in a I am definitely in a point in my life where I need to be kind of single as well and grow as a person just like kind of unattached to anything and just to have fun I guess but yeah so I that's what I did I started journaling I started making plans kind of went into hyperdrive just kind of got ahead of my feeling so yeah yeah because I knew what was coming yeah so is this um when you say you knew what was coming do you mean in terms of like like sort of like where your feelings would go or are you talking more like was this before like the breakup I guess was like done no I'm talking about where my feelings would go like I knew like this was gonna be a very very it's gonna it was gonna be a tough situation yeah I'm pretty bad at something I've learned through the breakup and um I took a personality test or sorry what was an attachment test like different attachment types yeah different attachment types and like I knew I knew this before and too but so my attachment type came out as okay first of all I don't really like labels like that too much like I feel like there's a spectrum and people yeah yeah um tend to overuse labels definitely yeah and kind of testify things for it but my my attachment style came out as anxious preoccupied which I think it makes sense like after reading all the description then so but no essentially I'm not gonna go into that but essentially like what I realized that still hold extra lecture on the attachment period yeah no please no wait what's interesting yeah um what I realized is like when I'm in a relationship with someone that I'm committed to especially a relationship like my last one I felt very like secure in it and it kind of it gave me purpose it gave me like the stability to take chances and grow for myself where it's like okay I know like I just felt very secure and very confident and very like ready to face the world and grow and yeah um confident in your sense of self sense of self you can do all these different things and this is something I'm dealing with right now I like I feel like a lack of purpose um like I feel like I feel like I'm floating I don't know what I'm doing why I'm doing what I'm doing like work feels like a chore like yeah I mean work is a chore but it's just extra actually yeah I can't bring myself to do it yeah yeah and it's just like I don't know I'm like it's taking the fun out of everything yes and it's yeah it's to the point where like I'll be out of concert or something and it's like and I just won't feel the excitement or joy and I'm supposed to feel out of concert yeah yeah when you surround with all this energy and all these people yeah there's so much love in the air um well your friends are there yeah there's booze and drugs and great right but just just mentally I'm just somewhere else you know in my own world I got you um and yeah so yeah it sucks because I mean it sucks for me obviously but it sucks I feel I feel like it sucks for people around me too because I feel like it got it's it's an it feels like a negative vibe on their experience yeah where it's like I'm I feel like a burden I feel like something that's a detracting yeah yeah um and so yeah no that makes a lot of sense I mean yeah like I mean I'm sure you know this already but since like we've been spending a lot of time together after your breakup just like you know that you don't have to feel like a burden like yeah so we're like oh we have to drag this guy along because he's down like no no you're good but I understand exactly how you feel like I yeah yeah like especially uh yeah I mean I think like you're like they're like different aspects to it like the depression of the breakup and then like you're saying like when you don't have that like strong sense of self like it's hard like even if you're like it can feel like going through the motions because it's like you almost like lose your ability like the things which were meaningful in your life like no longer like really make sense in the same way you're the same way you're meaning but I mean like yeah you're the one going through the breakup you should be probably talking about this more than no yeah yeah you're exactly right yeah that's exactly what's happening yeah and I guess that's what the that's what the healing process is yeah for um that's what the months and however long it takes after the breakup just to kind of regain that sense of yeah purpose find it and other things outside of the relationship I mean the last thing I want to do or anyone should do in the situation like this is to go into another relationship yeah it's like you're just carrying forward all your problems to the other relationship and not really giving yourself time to heal yeah um just a very like aggressive form of what you're saying where it's like taking on something else to distract yourself pretty much yeah I mean I I have been dating since I was like 13 or 14 and um even before this before this relationship I was in another relationship that I mean I shouldn't have been in in the first place I was not yeah in the right headspace for that but after it ended I didn't really take the time to heal and be my own person and got you I kind of I met this person that I was with and it was just it was just magic it was amazing it was like for both of us um it just felt like everything we had been looking for and it was and in that moment it was tough to be like no wait we need to be single yeah yeah and kind of give that up yeah I don't regret it necessarily no I mean I don't regret it at all I think we had a great time but um and I don't know like who knows what will happen in the future you know I mean um so we'll see yeah um I guess like sort of like what do you I guess I guess there are like two aspects where what you're saying about how afterwards like you just found this person and then like like obviously like you didn't want to take a break or like give yourself that kind of like time because like it just seemed like everything was falling into place like I guess they're like two parts to what I wanted to ask which is that the first thing is like what do you feel like you should have yeah I guess we're going to start this what what do you feel like you should have or I guess like in retrospect like think that you should have like thought through and like engage with that you kind of avoided by just throwing yourself into a relationship well you know I feel like I feel like it's easy to look back and be like oh I should have done this yeah yeah definitely um I think I think we both acted in the best way we could in that situation um and it's unfortunate that we ended up in this position here yeah yeah um but I don't think we could have done anything differently in that oh yeah yeah I got you but in this case like I'm definitely now that I'm in and now that I'm here I can confidently say that yes I do need to spend time yeah be single and be free you know I think yeah I think a big thing for me specifically has been I've been stressed my entire tea late teen adult life um if not for um not stressed but like just occupied with the dodging yeah where it's like just all the time I'm thinking about something I'm building something planning something yeah um if it wasn't for if it wasn't grades in school it was internships and college and you know feeling it's feeling a feeling being behind like going to going to a college and being surrounded by a bunch of geniuses yeah um you know oh man I was feeling insecure about it and so just dealing with that and and then now like the last few months I work at a startup yeah and that sends January I think it it was it has been really rough like I've been dealing with burnout um and then even while dealing with like all of that um you know a mess of a work situation where there's high pressure and I'm working like 12 14 16 hours a day sometimes sometimes on weekend um taking care of that also taking care of a relationship along this since relationship continuously traveling lying down to see her to go on vacations taking care of my like working out like oh yeah so just having so much on your mind yeah stressing you out all the time yeah um um I know that I need to let go of a lot of that and just yeah focus on myself and really just ask myself hey like what do I want to do and just focus on that yeah yeah and not worry about anything or anyone else got you no that makes sense yeah I think a lot of people do that like just so like I mean I do it myself like you get so prepared preoccupied with all the things that you feel like you want to or you need to do in your life that like you end up like sacrificing like your own like self-duist and extent and like you lose the ability to like take that time to like gain perspective on like okay like why am I doing these things like like what do I what am I really like moving towards like what am I trying to accomplish um any I guess like now that you had some time like do you feel like you've made had any insights about yourself like things that you were neglecting things that I was neglecting um well I think maybe neglecting is the wrong word but I like putting off I guess yeah that you had to prioritize yeah that I'd be prioritized yeah I mean things that I've been starting to work on now now that I have more I guess time for lack of a better word and energy um but uh yeah I I've been really wanting to get into a music production I've always kind of had this vision of myself as a it's gonna sound really corny but as a as a DJ just like performing for people yeah whether it's like my music or remixes or just yeah yeah just picking good songs you know that's the thing of a DJ myself yeah exactly every house party right I got you yeah no I think so I've had this vision and I feel like that's the only thing that I've thought of that's like oh hey like that's something that I would actually like to do and enjoy doing something you're passionate about and yeah and so I'm taking a stab at music production and I'm going to see where it goes yeah that's right he may not go in that direction it probably won't but uh at least I'm taking the chance to learn now and uh yeah yeah another thing that I've been doing is um getting back into reading a little bit so I picked up a few books I read Never Wear by Neil Gaiman and that was that was a nice book because the protagonist in the book is this person who kind of has his whole life blended from him and he has to start fresh from creating new identity in a place that he doesn't belong um metaphors yeah metaphor so um that was that was a fun book it was kind of fitting yeah it is recommended by strangers on Reddit it's like books to read after Greg another book that I've been reading is Meditations by Marcus Reles classic classic and I've also picked up Shashi um reading getting into I've never been that much into Greek mythology I think honestly I don't think I've read anything after like Percy Jackson yeah I mean I can yeah they don't really have like books for Greek mythology it's just like stories there spin up yeah yeah yeah I know you're more into that realm oh yeah like the you mean like the Ilya the honestly shit like that yeah yeah I mean I only got into it because of knowledge like I think like a classic class out of the uh like just as a G but uh yeah I enjoyed it a lot a lot more than I was expecting because I'm also like kind of like especially once you get this stuff like that where it's like the like even like a way of writing in a certain sense makes it like so distant and like sort of makes you approach it as like research and not like reading in a traditional sense like I was surprised with how like powerful I found it and like how much like like there is a lot of like emotional depth and like a lot to relate to even after like 2000 years just insane and yeah I mean those new books are just keeping up the same tradition right yeah homerp was probably but it heard some like kulasmits and he's like damn I'm right fanfiction about this shit but we're also starting to write uh books about Hindu mythology the same way oh like there have been a yeah Greek mythology like like Sarsi their books like that I read something called Forrest of Enchantments recently and that was just like that's like a it's like a feminist retelling of the Ramayana which is really cool and there are a lot I know there's like there's more like fantasy kind of books like the Jasmine throne and stuff like that so that's like a whole new genre that's coming up this that does neat it's pretty cool yeah yeah just curious like how do you feel about like like fiction versus nonfiction in sense because you've been reading a lot of fiction but then you also read like meditations right yeah I mean I enjoy the nonfiction a bit more I would say yeah even though it's nice to like escape into the fiction um sometimes I last year I read a lot of bell hooks um then my favorite one was the will to change and it just it just it just brought to lay in a lot of things yeah maybe you know like maybe deep down you know but like it really brought it out and yeah made you understand things about the world a little bit more um why things are the way they are yeah yeah and yeah I got I got a lot out of them yeah yeah so that's what I'd say like nonfiction like I tend to get more out of yeah I got and grow more from yeah now those are my favorite books it's almost like I feel like I'm carrying with them where it's like they just change the way that the world looks to you and it's just like yeah you they change the way you look at yourself so why do you feel like you're reading a lot of fiction now then is it just like chance or uh think it's nice to like get involved in something like a different world yeah escape on yeah exposure to different personality different situations yeah stuff like that is cool something else like it's new right yeah yeah especially in a time where you're like okay like I need to seek out something different now yeah so it's nice to be able to be exposed to those kind of things yeah yeah but yeah so no reading reading has been reading has been fun I I also am in therapy and therapy has been big um I think I was in therapy for a bit last year too um but no it's it's it's it's really nice I think everyone on some level like yeah would benefit from therapy no matter how successful you are or how you know I feel like there's always things that are kind of tangled up in small things it may be affecting you in ways that you don't even realize yeah and so that's been nice for me because it's helped me I think for me especially like places where I get stuck in a loop it like helps me first of all talking about it yeah like being able to vent but also like realizing things as you're saying it yeah trying to explain your situation to someone yeah yeah that helps and also just like when you're stuck it's like they'll be able to point out things are like ask you questions that go behind which the reason why you're stuck yeah yeah and kind of force you to think about that instead of being caught up in those yeah yeah and that helps that helps yeah and not just for breakers I think it helped me last year when I was I don't know like as more in my head about like work work like the lines kind of undoing some of my like need to always be on kind of thing and so that it helped a lot um yeah that's great yeah now I always say right like it's like we don't just go to the doctor like when we're feeling really unhealthy right like we go every year for checkups like why wouldn't you be the same for mental health right like you want to you want to catch these like like you're saying like they're little problems but they can always like metastasize they can always like just like essentially like in fact and like start to like poison like other parts of your life so yeah no I definitely agree and like for me too it's like honestly like been life changing kind of like just going through therapy and like making that sort of progress like yeah yeah yeah you feel lighter right yeah definitely like and at the end of the day like don't you want to be the best person you can be yeah exactly um not just for yourself but for people around you yeah yeah you have an impact on everyone around you so when you're do like things that you know may not um sit well with others or yeah you know in fact others in a negative way you want to undo them because you want to be good for everyone yeah yeah yeah anyways no but doing things like this podcast I think this was yeah it was important to me I've been I've been writing mainly journal or other types of writing to like like pro I don't want to say poetry but like prose maybe it's it's funny like I the reason I say I don't want to say poetry is because like I feel like I don't know what the definition of a poem is because I feel like anything that just sounds good is in a short yeah is a poem yeah you need to be short bro anything that's poetic yeah um but yeah so it doesn't follow any rules like it doesn't rhyme it doesn't just call it free verse free verse that's why I say prose it sounds good yeah I got you so yeah it's I'm doing that kind of stuff I'm yeah I have some stuff on what pad actually dang but it's you won't find it it's under nailiest so I'm meant to keep it to my life don't challenge me like that the next podcast episode is just gonna be us reviewing your you know please this reminds me of a back-in-middle school we edited and revised someone else's a lot better story for them which is somehow even worse than writing your own that's like wow you're taking it way too see yeah yeah exactly it's let me just a lot pad bro yeah but even the lot padwriters are like it's wrong with you I don't know that I don't know I don't want to hate on what pads oh yeah oh yeah all jokes yeah I mean it does do a good thing or did yeah people I mean it gives them a platform yeah people who aren't prose no no I wonder if some of them actually become it published authors but you know I mean this isn't a good example of a published author but you know like the 50 shades of gray author like that that started as Twilight Confiction oh really yeah that's it was literally Twilight Confiction and then she changed the name so she wouldn't get sued what she published it that's crazy and it also makes a lot of sense yeah there's heard a lot of what had content is yeah really sexual yes um you've heard I've heard definitely I do not read a rotted pick I heard a friend yeah um um anyways I think I'd been traveling I've been so after after I mean I was traveling before the break us two but um I'd been to like Europe already and stuff um yeah but after the break up I actually went to um I went down to Tulum with buddy of mine it's very lucky that he wanted to go actually because I was in no position to go on yeah um so we went down to Tulum for a week and that was that was really fun actually Tulum is a very interesting but it's a lot a lot of a lot of influencers and I want to say want to be influencers I don't know I'm gonna have to look them up I get it where's the line between influencer and wanted I mean I honestly I don't know yeah yeah I mean maybe it's just a number of followers yeah I mean I more meant that rhetoric we wasn't expecting you to give me a line well but it's fun I think there's yeah at the same time there's a lot of culture as well yeah a lot of parties the techno scene goes hard into you I'll tell you that thing um they've got this like hippie vibe going on um it's an interesting hippie vibe it's like it's fun I saw Ganesha idols on the streets and in the clubs and classic you randomly just see spar with the air she about outside and it's like okay cool okay I guess I could dig this I'm not too sure but like it at the same time it's cool there's a lot of mine yeah symbols and statues yeah stuff like that as well um got you so yeah that was a great experience although like I will again like going back to the being present that was definitely tough yeah it did more good than harm yeah so success in my book I guess yeah um so I also went to Yellowstone for a bit oh with my family that was that was interesting that was like going to Yellowstone I mean amazing amazing nature and scenery and it's really beautiful yeah unreal almost yeah but it's having family there is nice because they're really supportive in a time like that especially but it's also kind of a pain because it's like they don't just let you be sad yeah yeah it's like they don't give you that space yeah it's like they're like trying to cheer you up yeah it's like man I just don't want to be sad yeah I just want to stay in my room yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know we got through it again we probably did more good than harm yeah yeah I'm fine I had just been sitting in a room all day for two weeks three weeks then yeah right after the breakup then yeah not the answer you probably would not have been in a good place so yeah it was gonna be shitty is one of those things it was gonna be shitty no matter me yeah and where I was yeah yeah so whatever I did just felt like yes yeah yeah yeah and I think like like in my experience a lot of times when I want to be sad is the times when I should least be like like I should least allow myself to do that when it's like not necessarily helpful you know yeah absolutely so are you like have you been like pretty open with your family about like the breakup and everything or yeah I think we have the I mean not everything everything of course the light up yeah we have a good relationship so they've been very supportive okay yeah that's great and yeah my family has been really supportive my friends have been close friends have been really supportive as well yeah and very very thankful for them I think they're the ones keeping me up so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah got you okay um cool so then I guess getting back more into like the breakup itself um so in terms of like those things that you've been doing how much uh I guess what's like you're gonna wait for this like how like how much of those have been helping in terms of like helping like process and like move through the breakup um I yeah it's very difficult to I guess like quantify like answering your question like that but I'm just curious if like anything stood out to you like yeah um I think what I've noticed especially this I noticed with the music production I started one of the first things I did was try to start getting into it and the thing is there's a learning curve yeah it's your production before you can even think of producing something that's just like yeah even remotely listen before right um or just being able to translate like what's in your head onto a computer or a dog it's like that that has a lot of learning curve and so when I was like going through that it kind of just felt like a job and the one thing I realized is in a situation like this where you're going through something and you want to kind of divert that energy and occupy yourself and get something out um the thing that helps is to get into something that you can just you can just the emotions can just flow and you can create right off the yeah yeah you know um and because the music production thing it was like it started to feel like a job yeah yeah yeah um like it was just yeah like work yeah and so um yeah it makes sense what I ended up doing was I started writing yeah yeah um and I think that helped quite a bit yeah um I and honestly just doing things that I wouldn't have done yeah before it's kind of crazy but like um I started watching anime like I then this is something that if you know me I would have never watched like I watched Avatar I love you I love Pokemon you just offended like so many people by calling this anime yeah exactly exactly and that's why I said that's why I don't watch anime I didn't I never claim to be a weird joke um but I was like you know I might as well give this a shot yeah I started with Vinland Sargo great show is probably one of the best shows I've seen where you very well put together like across the board not just anime across yeah I mean I don't know if I would say top five shows of all time yeah it was a very well-produced show um and I thoroughly enjoyed it yeah um and uh I yeah so Vinland Sargo started what I watched Death Note but I only watched like half of it because it got really weird after like episode 17 yeah and the current one I'm watching now is a tech-on-titan yeah um and uh yeah that's been a good show um so far it has a good lot of potential and I heard good things so I'm gonna see it through um but uh yeah other than other than anime I've been um I've been I've been going to the gymmore um trying to go at least twice a day um not at least at least once a day um trying to go twice a day or just like one big really long session obviously like obviously a lot of it is filled by insecurities um yeah at this stage but getting in shape is something that I've been wanting to do yeah and so I guess I'm just writing the wave and using the fuel yeah um that's all of something that I have like travel like I guess hashing out is like when like you're doing something like good or constructive but then you like it's for the wrong reasons like you're being driven by a security it's like like should you give into that feeling should you not yeah you know I it's a valid question yeah I don't have the energy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um no I think for you so yeah I'm just gonna write the way yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I've been getting into kickboxing that has been that has been fun it's it's always I feel like it's really fun to punch something and get that kind of release of energy yeah punching and kicking and doing all those sweaty combos but yeah no I mean just doing things that you may not have done before yeah maybe on your mind some things that weren't even weren't on your mind just taking a chance I've been wanting to get a motorcycle license so I might do that yeah and I go skydiving um I think honestly I think my list is maybe too big I might get laser sir you're gonna get rid of my glasses um I don't know we'll see yeah yeah yeah so I guess then like taking a step back from like all the things you're doing to heal I guess like I just wanted to ask you what the healing process has looked like so far and what exactly healing means to you when you talk about healing after a break up what has the healing process looked like um it's it's been I've learned a lot I think after the whole phase of journaling like a madman I've been dealing with a lot of denial first because it's it's very easy to hold on to the things that give you the most comfort me a moment because regardless of what may or may not happen in the future the reality is that you have to move on yeah and at the heart of it it's it's really a the ability to be feel whole by yourself you know yeah and so that's what I have to work on for the most part until now has just been for me just been about feeling my feelings because the moment I tried to distract myself from them in whatever ways um that's when I stopped making promise because I still had a lot to process and feel out yeah um and just understand and I think two really big things that helped me recently one was a was when I took turns two weeks ago um and just became very acutely aware of how lonely I was yeah it was a very intense experience like I didn't see visuals or anything I was listening to music and just sitting in the park and like I was just really feeling my emotions to the fullest extent and I I understood why I was feeling so shitty is just like hey like yeah like this is depression like I was like I was reading up on it and all that and stuff and just being able to put a name on it and be like oh that makes sense yeah it took the guilt out of it yeah um it took some weight off of it and so it feels a little bit lighter yeah yeah that makes sense and so that's where I'm at I think it's more than that it's tough for me to answer that question because I don't know what healing is yeah entirely yeah because I'm not very yet yeah yeah um I think it means to get to a place where you've kind of just feel whole by yourself and are not you know thinking all day about someone or something or not feeling terrible not feeling terrible yeah to me that's what it means right now guys you know that makes sense what I realize is like most people go through this at some point you end it is it is something that will help me grow and so it's okay yeah yeah yeah when you were talking about I guess like trying to find a reason for what your feelings had and sort of I guess like feeling guilty um like do you feel like like do you feel like you're almost blaming yourself for feeling bad about the breakup it kind of it goes back to like what we might would probably start talking about um earlier but being first of all a burden to yourself right burden to your current self yeah um and also burden to people around you yeah yeah I'm not the full version of myself yeah but now that I don't have that yeah it feels like I have no base you know yeah because like prioritizing yourself and growth and all that stuff like it's like it's like growing on top of some on top of the base right yeah so yeah I need to build this stronger foundation within myself yeah now that makes sense yeah it's always so hard like yeah I feel like sometimes like at least for me it's like I almost take things for granted like I take for granted that like certain things will always be there and then it's like when those things are gone and when I'm like when it's like coming to terms with like like it almost feels like like it feels like it's almost like hard for me to believe that like it is like it will be possible for me to be okay without those things and like just like coming to terms with that and getting yourself to really believe that can be so hard yeah I mean it goes back to like hey it doesn't feel real yeah yeah like it doesn't like it feels like something is wrong like it like yeah yeah yeah like an alternate random alternate world that you're putting it's like what this doesn't make any sense how did I get here how did I get here yeah you look down and you see the building has no foundation yeah asking for help is the hardest thing to do a lot of the time like especially when you order that down it's like you're already like like we don't normally have to ask those people for support and it's like like when you're already feeling so shitty it's like putting in that extra effort like it's so easy to like convince yourself or like to sort of like makes uses and not reach out but yeah yeah you definitely need to and it's honestly like shocking every time like how willing people are to like give a hand like when you're struggling yeah give them the chance to surprise you if you're cynical yeah yeah yeah definitely agree speaking for an experience the big cynic are you big cynic huh ah this two shall pass this two shall pass yeah yeah this two shall pass I I saw a video of Tom Hanks saying it once but that kind of hit the spot yeah yeah no definitely like sometimes yeah you just need to remind yourself that when it feels like it won't be okay when like you're saying like there's that part in your brain that's just screaming like this is wrong like I shouldn't be here like being able to just tell yourself that like it won't you won't always feel like that yeah yeah I mean another thought that comes to mind right and I'm sure it comes to everyone's mind when they're feeling shitty is like oh there are people out there with way bigger problems yeah like people are dealing with all kinds of grief all kinds of problems yeah poverty homelessness death like yeah and so that's another reason yeah people I know I have that's like like put yourself down and not kind of it kind of invalidate how you're feeling yeah but the thing is like I think what I've seen is like it's good to give yourself perspective yeah feelings are really yeah are real yeah if you push them down like that they're gonna come out in bad ways yeah so you need to feel them yeah I mean you can always find someone who's worse off than you right yeah but it's like that doesn't mean that like your problems aren't legitimate any less than like you're happiness is legitimate because obviously they're gonna be people who are happier right yeah yeah it's like it's hard like yeah being able to balance all of that balancing like on one hand like gaining the perspective by like realizing like that you still have a lot of good in your life well at the same time like not letting your brain like jump on that as a reason to like diminish your own feelings like it's always a struggle yeah you know what's really out though I have I have a playlist songs by myself I'm just a little patient yeah I made a playlist called desolation it's funny if you know me because it's all the same the M songs because I listen to those anyway those are my go-to's but no I made a playlist and that's that's what I've been having on repeat yeah I just can't I think recently I heard you Tokyo so I'm trying to listen to other music yeah uh but yeah it's it's mostly been the yeah and I mean there's some there's some kills strokes and Arctic monkeys and Sizzan there and Lincoln Park oh god so much like a park there's too much Lincoln Park in there in the end in the end yeah crawling yeah the amount of times have lasted these songs and EDM songs yeah they helped me they helped me feel what I'm feeling it's like validating yeah it's weird it's validating you know yeah yeah yeah I don't know that that makes no no no I understand yeah yeah yeah yeah it's nice to like like don't feel like someone else has like gone through what you're feeling yeah it's I feel like 95 percent of music is either about love or breakups or situations yeah there's a lot of music there's a lot of situations it's yeah yeah literally just relationships like every type no I mean it's like one of like in terms of human experiences like like one of the strongest things right there we go there yeah so I guess like apart from like I guess apart from the things that you struggled with was there anything that you expected to help but didn't and when did you realize that I thought the travel would help hope yeah but then at some point I realized like traveling was nice as an initial like way to recover from the initial shock yeah but after that it was kind of preventing me from getting into like a new routine yeah because traveling is it's like yeah it's nice to mean people and stuff like that but it doesn't it doesn't allow you to like dive into a new something you know like create an identity in that way yeah um it's a break from life yeah I'm gonna step forward exactly so I needed to kind of go back and create some kind of routine yeah and so that's what I did make sense yeah yeah other than that I mean I guess like it's one of those things like like taking it one day at a time yeah it's like like it doesn't it doesn't work like oh you take it a day at a time for a couple days and then it's like good you know yeah you have to keep doing it you have to keep almost pretending that like not pretending but like gaslighting yourself you know and to think thinking yeah okay it's okay like we're just gonna do this today and um we'll take it one day at a time and so it's kind it's kind of misleading in the sense that like it's it's continuous effort yeah yeah another thing is dating apps I mean I I downloaded at some point in the last month I downloaded you know Tinder and Bumble and and yeah I mean it was purely purely out of insecurity like it was just like something that I did to combat the feeling of like oh what if you know whatever it may be like and just trying to combat that so yeah but clear I mean I was not ready for any I literally I downloaded the app and I just kept it there for like four days yeah I didn't even do it and then the four days later I like created login yeah and then I didn't do any that didn't make a profile or anything and then a couple days after that I made a profile yeah I was like okay this is so weird yeah did not think I'd be here yeah but um yeah so I kept it for like it's think a week I realized it was not doing me any good yeah um like I had matches and stuff but it was just like it was the reason I kept going on it was I mean I kept opening it every time I felt really sad or lonely yeah which was a lot right but it was just a way for me to escape those feelings and deal with them yeah and not replacing them with anything constructive yeah no that makes sense yeah so it was not doing me any good yeah um so I deleted them but I mean yeah so that didn't help but like I guess it helped in the way that like to know that I was able to get on the app yeah get matches I guess yeah um that was good enough yeah bit of a confidence boost not confidence I would say I would say it's more like a security inside I can do this too no that makes sense honestly like I think that's like a big thing too is being able to like sort of what we've been talking about like you're getting to know that is like being able to differentiate when you actually want to do something and when like it's just doing insecurity driving you like having that sort of like mindfulness and like that awareness of like okay like this like sort of being able to understand where that feeling is coming from and being able to like differentiate between like when are you just like like throwing yourself into something like kind of like irrationally or like mindlessly versus like when are you actually like doing towards something yeah yeah no that's fair I mean and this is one of those situations where it's like it's just purely out of the city yeah yeah not any need yeah um and so it just made the decision to get rid of it um delete Facebook at the gym yeah I mean I'm off I'm off all social media like I have read it I even deleted read it for a while um by the way like read it was it's it was both helpful and it was also not like it just depends how you use it yeah but it yeah like there are some subreddits that really helped me in the beginning um like there's subreddit called x-no contact yeah and it's just when you're dealing with some with situation like this where you're feeling lonely and want to talk to your ex because it's the natural thing to do it's like and you know like anything happens like I'm talking to yeah my ex you know happy sad whatever and in a time of such emotional distress like that's the person you're gonna turn to naturally right yeah by the way for these subreddits like you just look at the pinned post like you don't have it because they have good information and I'm like oh like why is it that you want to do yeah yeah and like why you shouldn't do this yeah and just like motivation and trying to help you get through yeah and it's also nice in a limited way to see other people yeah um struggling with the struggling with the same thing yeah relating to your struggles yeah yeah um and you see that and it's in the beginning it's nice it's but then there comes a certain point where it just keeps you in that zone yeah so you also have to know when to get rid of it yeah and when like being cognizant it's like okay I've gotten what I need from this yeah I can let this go yeah same thing with our slash breakups our slash breakups okay our stuff breakups is really only for the first week after you break up with someone because outside of that it just it becomes it it's a place to go and send really hard on yeah extreme levels and after that it just becomes sad yeah like it's a kind of a problem yeah yeah um so use it with caution that's almost like like the whole thing about the internet and then that cell right what makes it so complicated like on one hand like there's so much like community and so many resources that you can get from other people who are like struggling from the same things but on the other side it's like it's so easy to just fall into this negative feedback loop of like oh well these people are like bitter about their x's and like so fixated on that that like you can also just hold you back all right let's like make a bit of a topic shift for over from like healing coping talking about like how you've been like moving through the breakup itself and then shift over more onto like your experience now that you're single so less I guess on like the emotional tall of like the break up itself and more like now that you no longer have that person in your life like moving forward without them um but yeah so I guess like um now now that you're single like what do you feel like the hardest part that is I think it's it's just being happy with yourself and this by yourself because I look back over the last four years and the happiest moment that I've had were with my ex yeah like it's just having those same experiences those amazing experiences and not having someone to share that with yeah is is heart-wrenching it's like it's it feels very empty um yeah yeah be that like concerts or Sundays you know just like lazying yeah now home going to movies yeah yeah just anything right yeah and because you can you can surround yourself with friends and stuff but they're not going to fill the void that a partner has right a partner is with you constantly yeah every moment even if you're long distance it's like if you're both freed like you're just hanging out you're talking here yeah and having a date night and that's like partying um yeah and so just learning how to spend those moments with yourself is difficult that's something that I'm both not looking forward to and also feel like I have to tackle figuring out how to feel a hole in those situations is going to be tough and especially like for my specific my situation specifically like I didn't have much time for myself yeah outside of work like I all my most of my free time and energy was spent trying to figure out like you know how to spend time spend time with my acts like fly down whatever it may be yeah yeah or planning planning to what I'm a big planner so it's like that's my love language too it's like my love language is acts of service and yeah you know planning things and yeah that's how I showed that and so not having someone to do that for is really hard yeah yeah almost like not being able to express like that sort of like compassion and love yeah yeah I mean another thing is just being around couples kind of sucks like there's a lot of couples everywhere um most of our friends most of them most of our friends literally me right now literally you right now yeah it's yeah I mean it's just like I wish everyone the best to you no no I understand it's it's funny I'm like I'm in a place right now where it's like I love it's unreal it's stupid it doesn't make sense it's um oh my god yeah it's it's all a sham you know yeah there is a sham relationships are a sham yeah everyone's gonna die alone yeah um um by i'm also aware of how um biased that like no no no I'm perfectly fair right like considering where you are enough like I think that's honestly like something people don't talk about enough which is just like I mean there are lots of times like I have like resentful feelings like that it's like it's not like you were you actually like hey any of us or anything it's like like you can't like avoid the fact that you're gonna feel like like that way and like obviously like that's gonna like like yeah we all have those feelings sometimes and like it's perfectly understandable yeah no I mean if you have those feelings it's just like be respectful yeah be respectful of people around you and of course and if you see someone who's going through a breakup and has noticed them acting weird around your partner like when you guys are with around couples and stuff don't take a personal thing yeah choose to excuse themselves because they're probably having a really shit yeah yeah no definitely yeah yeah yeah a feeling can never be wrong just how you express it absolutely but I was really looking forward to this summer because it was finally in this place where it's like oh I was able to change out of this job yeah you get a job the way I felt like my mental health would be better yeah I have more time it's the summer you know I'm happy yeah I mean it's it's just it's supposed to be the best time of the year and it was really looking forward to it after being so down for most of the year yeah um it's I've just seen that meme where it's like oh like the meme former it's like oh what if what if I said I'm ready to have a great time and have good mental health but then but then God said yeah wait wait a second not so fast yeah back down the hole you go yeah that's what it felt like so there's like it feels like yeah there's a great plan for our episode I've heard recently which is that anytime you're having a good time never forget God's a hater God's a hater man I gotta solid week good time yeah yeah it's so good middle it'll come like yeah everything happens for a reason right yeah it's definitely hard though like especially when it's like your mood like yeah like when you have that image in your mind like you're trying to like tell you're probably telling yourself like they're out like the rest the time before that right those rough months you're having like you had that like vision in your head of the good times to come I'm going through dealing with processing it and also the grief of losing a person yeah so close to you so I don't know I don't know how long it's gonna take we'll see yeah makes sense yeah yeah definitely not something I feel like you can force you know yeah so feeling yeah it's yeah no that's very fair yeah because I think like like if you if you sort of like try to cross those barriers too quickly it's like it's so easy just to like like even if you might like in the moment it feels okay like you feel like you can separate it it's just like falling back into like the same sort of like routines and like behaviors like you you can almost I feel like fall back into like wanting the relationship without even trying to you know yeah yeah or like just certain aspects of it yeah so I guess like we've touched on this like throughout the conversation obviously but I guess I just wanted to put it in I guess greater relief but what what do you feel like are like the biggest perspective changes in general you that like after the breakup and now that you're no longer in a relationship so I'm thinking they're like like reflections on the relationship itself like new perspectives on it that you didn't have before on your your own sense of self I can you sort of touched on that like yeah yeah like how it's impacted your own sense of self but on like yeah how you view life in general like how you view your friendships anything stand out to you I mean I think I think I've realized what that relationship was giving me and kind of being able to see that what it was giving me where it was where it was great where it was amazing where it was not so great just being able to see those things get perspective from that just learning that and coming to terms with the fact that hey my story is unwritten yeah or yeah and it's it's very much coming just coming to terms with the fact that everything's up in the air you and that's it like honestly I don't have I don't have anything on share or yeah any huge realizations other than that I need a plan less tell you that I need to plan a lot less than I do yeah and this live moment to moment just follow the feeling I guess stay grounded stay grounded do you feel like there are any ways that and I mean you know like we don't necessarily have to go into this because I think it is something that is like very raw and very hard to talk about kind of related to like there's that we talked about but are there any like I guess negative changes that you haven't liked about your perspective negative changes about my perspective um I mean I don't like that I don't like couples and just love in general yeah it's just it's just annoying that I don't have it yeah I had it and it was great because I'm soft in the wound that's spattered honestly so yeah I can't imagine going on social media on Instagram yeah I just I probably won't until it's time to promote this audio this podcast yeah I thought you were about to say when it's time for you to promote your DJ sets for my oh yeah that'll probably take some time yeah this will just look on first yeah eventually for that yeah that's fair social media is bad enough normally ah absolutely I think the goal of this was... because I do enough of this already, but the goal of this was to kind of open it up and start the discussion about like, hey breakups are really shitty and if you're going through something, please talk about it and hopefully if you all have gone through something or if you're drawing there's something remotely similar like hopefully you had something to relate to. And if there's anything you want to talk about please reach out to your friends to anything on your mind, anything that's holding you down, weighing you, please reach out to your friends and your family and loved ones and loved ones and yeah if you have any like comments and thoughts and this helped you in any way, please reach out and let us know because we're that's the goal here, we're trying to connect with people and make them realize things about themselves and show that okay to talk about it, so okay to talk about your issues even if you're going through a tough time or depression and anxiety, whatever it is, please talk. Yeah honestly like I would love like if we got I guess like responsive and like other people's like lots and like breakups and stuff like just like next step so like spend some time like going over the best ones. Absolutely, I would be great. I mean we like it's always better like the more perspectives that are the better, right? Yeah that's that's what we're doing this for. Yeah not to make my struggles public. That can help too expressing yourself. I guess it's in this part of the depression. Sure. All right sweet. Thanks everyone. Yeah thank you all so much for listening. We'll see you for next time with a different topic and this time it won't be an interview of me. Remember to like, comment and subscribe. Of course. Oh that's good. Please. And bro, should I please donate to our patreon? Of course. Donate to our patreon. But no, I'm a serious enough please. Please if you like if you like what we're doing here and if you think there is a need for this please let us know. So we have the motivation to keep we're gonna try something we'll see if it sticks. But we're going to do like a song of the week song of the episode kind of thing where we'll just we'll just have a pick of a song and then just put put a link to it. Yeah. Just based on mood or whatever is hitting right now. Yeah. So for me this week I'm gonna go with Crawl Out of Love by Elenio. I think this song has been really hitting. Just the lyrics, the music, just everything. Wonder why. I saw it live. Dude Elenio has some crazy sets. But I saw it live. It was amazing. I actually saw he did there's a remix with time. Oh the hint. The Hans Zimmer. It's on YouTube. Yeah. That's just so good. Like it actually like put some headphones on, listen to it. Like if you don't have your ad banging like I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Like it just hits. I can't really imagine how hard that goes. That's my song of the week. I'll put a link to both. Yeah. The YouTube, the time remix and also the normal song. Most importantly the remix. Yeah. What about you man? For me I mean I guess I've been listening to you tear up here a lot. It was that came up soon. So I guess God's country was probably my song of the week. That's one of my favorites from the album. What do you think of the album? So since my last time we talked, it's grown on me a lot. I do really like it. There is still that part where it's like I think that it's a lot less like I don't know. It's hard for me to tell when my assumptions are coming in but like I feel like a song's like like if you look at something like rodeo right? It's like a song like 902 I know has such a clear like concept right? Yeah. Like versus like in utopia like I feel like along it like I like like the melodies and I like like what he's doing but like the songs themselves are a lot less than memorable to me. I feel like they like like you said like 902 I know like it evokes like a specific emotion that makes a story. Yeah. I feel like that's missing from a lot of the songs in utopia. Yeah. From a lot of them. I think there's some like highlights like my eyes. That's one song I really like. Yeah. That's one where it's like just so out of left field like I would have never expected. Yeah. And that one's like very like I feel like like that's like the one song he mentions like Astro World every day that happened. Like there's actually some substance there. Yeah. Overall I agree. Like absolutely. Siren and Sura Banger. Siren. The gym song. You know. Yeah. I was like. Nice. I always wondered like you know it says like festie like set festie ball instead of like festival. Oh he says that? Yeah. Like meet me at the festive view. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So instead of festival he said meet me at the festive view. But I wonder if you thought we heard about like after Astro World telling people to meet at the festive moment. Yeah. Man there's some questionable things. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. But it's also like it's kind of like Travis is brand. Do you know what I mean? He said like he has to touch on like part of your himself. That's true. That's true. Yeah. We gotta go back to the room. Actually the best gym song on that album was Fina. Fina's pretty good. Yeah. Carvings are the weirdest. Yeah. Cool. That's it then. Right? That's the song of the week. Carl Adela and God's country.
