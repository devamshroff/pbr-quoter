 Hey man. Hey, what's up? Yo, you good? You seem kind of down. Yeah, yeah, man. It's just works been a lot and just so much going on. I'm just tired. Shit dude, I feel that. Do you want to talk about it? No, man. I'm fine. It's not that deep. I'll be fine. Like, nothing's gonna change anyway. Yeah, I hear you. But like, how's everything else? Did you, uh, oh, did you take that lung roll from the party? No, man. I just, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. All right, man. You're gonna open up a little bit. I mean, that's what friends are for, right? You can tell me anything. All right, man. Sure. Uh, you got a mic? What? A mic like a podcast mic and some headphones? A mic bro. What do you need a mic for? I feel like I just can't really open up and talk about my feelings unless I'm on a podcast. You know, is that cool? Uh, I mean, yeah, I guess. Sure. One sec. Let me, let me find this. So, hey, everyone. Welcome back to the show. Oh, I'm in. You sound locked in today, today. I signed Lockton. All right. Not not my usual aloof self that you know, today I'm very excited for today's episode. We have a very special guest today. There are many words to describe this man. He's kind, he's insightful, he's a writer, he's a director, he's a producer. I'm sure one day he'll be an actor, maybe like Erntino vibes we'll see. And he's also a product manager at one of your favorite tech companies. That's just wrong. Are you not? No. This is funny because like you're not the only person who have made that mistake and like a lot of people, I don't know why, but a lot of people have said that. So I'm a solution consultant. Well you give that vibe. I don't know. I don't know what it is. That sounds like an insult. I don't know. Is it? It does. But also consultant is just like one degree away anyway. Yeah. He's on the right track. That's true. That's true. Well my bad. He's a solutions consultant. Yeah. What do that mean? Yeah. What about me? Right. We'll have to dig into that a little bit later. But anyways, welcome to that. Thank you for having me. I'm a fan of the podcast actually. I've listened to many episodes. So it is very, very exciting for me to actually be on one of the episodes. And chat with you guys. Which one's your favorite? Ooh. The easy answer is, I mean, I obviously like we like to break up stuff. So it's like those ones are just so real, how low real and raw. And I think that is also very like brave of all of you and your guess to like talk about that stuff and record it and post it because it's very personal, right? And it's like a very like like not people will talk about like openly about their feelings and like are okay, which is like posting that online, which is like a very, very minimal thing. So I think that like definitely the the the juicy episodes, but also like the most like, oh wow, like, you know, like you can actually listen to this and like reflect on yourself and like, you know, life in general and all this things. So yeah, I gotta say that one. But it's hard to pick me on the stupid good ones. Gross compliment was that the episode was listenable? Yeah. What that is a huge compliment because like podcasts are like, you know, something like it's, I feel like it's hard. I was like this to I hear earlier, like it's hard to and they've a month or so these many times like it's hard to like make a podcast that people will sit and listen to for like over and like it's hard to make a short video while watch for 10 minutes. Definitely. Let alone like like a podcast of people who can do for an hour. So if you can do that, do you have none? Like that's huge. No, I appreciate you saying that. I feel like those episodes were honestly the most fun to record too. There was a lot of time. We just learned this from so I was also not gonna lie when you asked it first, like which ones are favorite? I thought you were asking which host is your favorite? And I was like, this is bullshit, bro. I'm not winning this competition. No, dude, I hear it put in work. We met, you know, we chatted, we had a deep conversations and all that. So like, you know, he was really in that position of our favorite host and honestly, he's kind of up there right now. He knows he knows a lot of park manager. That's one. Yeah. Did you actually remember that? Yeah, we had a whole conversation about his sweater because it said, I see you. Yeah. I see. I see. I study for this shit. You didn't there. Yeah. I guess I can't. You know, someone too long, like you forget all the original details, you know, and then I think that just that just goes to show how many competitions we have not about work, which is a good thing, right? Yeah. I feel you guys. What's your name again, bro? So how have you guys been? Let's start there. Obviously, like, well, you guys aren't here, but it's really beautiful here. 75 degrees. First 70 plus degree day of the year. Very excited for that moment. I'm not going to, you know, brag about that. I'll you. Yeah, please don't. I was he says after he brags about it. Yeah, just brag about it for so I'm unfortunately, so I'm not not unfortunately. I'm recording this from home in the very area currently. So I'm not in New York. I'm usually there. I actually live like, like, be boxed away from the day of them. So usually I'm there and I'm very, very jealous that you guys can enjoy the beautiful weather in New York, because I feel like in California, the weather's usually like, okay, it's it's it's usually fine, but like when you're in New York and like what is usually shit and then like one day gets really nice, everyone goes outside. It's like everything has changed. Like, you know, everyone's like mood is up. It's a Saturday also. So like, um, everywhere I know is at the park, uh, at Central Park right now. And I'm very jealous, but I'm doing great. I'm I'm chilling. Uh, it's been a very nice quiet weekend so far. It's been nice to get like a little break from being with you for a while and like have a lot of quiet, uh, in space and car, you know, to drive around and stuff. Yeah, it's pretty good. I'm not gonna lie though. These all sound like coops to me. Yeah. Hey, hey, no, no, no, it is, it's very it's very true. It is very true. I was looking forward to being at home. So, uh, it's just me and my dog at home right now. So we've just been hanging out and unfortunately, yeah, if you, he, he, he's sleeping nearby and he tends to snore really loudly sometimes. So like, uh, he may interrupt the podcast, but I would just make sure you welcome an disruption. No problem. Yeah. Do you guys see the earthquake that happened in Thailand? My landmark? Oh, yeah. That she was crazy. Crazy. Yeah. That was insane. The Sony like videos of like swimming pools at the top of the Yeah, they like all the water falling while I wonder if anyone, I mean, okay, I don't, I don't know. No, you're not. But you know, if you're in the infinity pool and then you're in a waterfall, you know what I mean? Like you have, it's fine. I hope, I hope that didn't happen to anyone. I feel like it'd be kind of hard to for you to fall out of it, but like, like, like, imagine if you're like on a floaty, right? Oh, yeah. You're like lying on the water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. At point, yeah, you might be, you might be cooked. Yeah. I mean, I saw my whole last building. It's like tilted over like this. So I feel like even if you're inside, no laughing matter here. He says I pretty bring it up. I wasn't laughing. Hey, it's a coping mechanism. Oh, yeah. I'm not an asshole. Whatever you say. You know what I saw? Literally, this was so insane. I left for like five minutes. Someone asked a question. How does a brain anus rhythm instantly kill you? It was like a genuine question, explain like I'm fine. What is a brain anus rhythm? I know what it is. They're trying to say brain aneurysm. Aneurysm. But like, this is so crazy because I do this kind of shit sometimes. Like, I like, I like write how it sounds in my head instead of what the word actually is. And it'll just be like a completely different word and it doesn't make sense. It's like a subcrime thing. But I've seen my mom do it too. It's insane. I feel like that's just a general thing. Like, if you don't know how a word is spelled. It's not because you don't know how it's spelled. It's like it's not actually thinking about it. Yeah. Oh, I'm dumb. All right, let's just get into that episode. Yeah. What if we didn't know? It's so stupid. I think this is quality content. So I have a few topics that I'm really, you know, I really do want to talk about. First of all, let's start with new normal, right? So this is a show that you, Vivek, you wrote and you produced and you directed with your dad, which is insane. How? How was that? How was that whole process? Like, give us like three words to sum it up first and then we'd like dive into it. Okay. Three words. I would say educational, challenging and like unforgettable, I guess, is it? I'm trying to think of a word that's like something about like how like valuable that experience was unforgettable. I guess it's there. That's what we can go with that. In valuable, maybe? Yeah, in valuable. I feel like you could kind of retire. You could cut the entire intro of saying that I'm a writer and I'm a part of it because those things are not. We're going to cut back to that to emphasize. Yeah. Yeah. He just has a way with words. Exactly. Yeah. It was an insane, like year. I want to say, it was like a yeah, about a full year of us doing that. How it started. It's a very long story. I've told, I thought I told the story. I told the story to I hear recently and you look, you kind of there throughout the whole thing. But like, I've always been into filmmaking. Like, it's been like a passion, mind writing and directing. Like, I knew I wanted to do that for a very long time since I was in middle school. And honestly, even before that, I feel like a lot of people did this, you know, you'd make skits on your, like, phone and stuff and like, no one will ever see these. But there is out there on YouTube somewhere, there's like, it's that I wrote and directed and I get started myself as and like, it was like, I had up this flip camera. Like, I don't, I don't know if you guys remember flip cameras. But like, one year for my birthday, I asked my dad for a flip camera and he was like, yeah, sure. And I would make these skits. I do it was like maybe like two or three, but like, that was kind of the genesis of me realizing I was really into this. In addition to also being a writer, as a kid, like I wrote and published a few books because I was just like bored and like, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like self publishing, but it is publishing. Like, as a kid, you know, like, it was like, I was like a celebrity for like a hot five seconds in my neighborhood. And I was also the source of many other kids paying because like all their parents were comparing them to me and they're like, why didn't you write a book? Like, which is ridiculous, but I peaked in fifth grade. That's it. But I was really into writing and like, I knew I love movies and I was like making skits. I never kind of put them together. I never really thought about like, oh, like, how do you even like write a movie? Like, how does a movie like even, like, like, what has been as a script or a screenplay until like middle school and I started to kind of like look into screenwriting and started googling like how to, you know, write a script and just like free screenwriting software as I started writing my own stuff. And that kind of grew more as I went to high school and like, it's hard taking film classes and exploring that a lot more. And I think like my freshman year of high school, I went to a private school for one year, which had a really great film program. And like, they had like a whole studio and everything and like, did people who went to film school from there and I was like, oh, this is like, this is obviously exactly what I want to do. And I told my parents I was like, I want to go to film school. Like, I was terrified of doing it, um, of telling them that because like, obviously, you know, like, insane topic. And I remember I was like, I was so scared of telling them this, uh, that my plan, which I executed was, um, while I was at school, I wrote an email to my parents, um, explaining why I wanted to go to film school and sent it to them so that I didn't have to see their immediate reaction. And I could just like, so I got home and then see what they were saying, we see what they said. Um, which I think is kind of genius, honestly, like, but also like, keeping back, it's kind of ridiculous. But my parents were very supportive of like me pursuing this as a passion. But obviously, they were like, you can't go to film school. That's just ridiculous. We don't know anything about that. It's expensive. Like all these different, and the only reasons why they were like, you're not going to film school. That's just like a ridiculous idea. But like, they were extremely supportive in me, like, pursuing that as my creative passion. I was able to take my classes throughout high school, like, at different programs that had film programs and we had like a family friend who was a filmmaker, who he still was a filmmaker. And like, he is a works in tech, but like, it's very passionate about directing and writing and he been doing productions. And I got to go work on his set and he was like a three-day shoot. It was my first time on like a real, you know, indie film set. And it was the crazy experience. And this is through my parents. I've like, it's like a family friend. I learned so much from that. But, but yeah, ultimately did not go to film school. Like, I went to UCLA, Matt Devam. I really learned this is such a long story for your question about, you know, let's go to the let's find the lawyer. Yeah, I'll the lawyer in this game. Just get out of the way. Um, so yeah, I went to UCLA because I was like, okay, well, it's an LA. They have a good film program. I'm not majoring in films. I'm like, I didn't get into their film program, but like, at least I can do something out there. And continuously, like, you know, was trying to do film classes, but there was a point where like, I was like, I need to figure out my like real career and like, what I'm going to be like doing after I graduate and like, you know, what I need to do, like job wise. So there was a point where I kind of gave up on the film stuff. And then I was just like, can you focus on that? Figure that out. Uh, and actually did figure that out, but COVID hit and then, you know, things were like kind of in the flux and, uh, and I, I, from there, like, I took film classes, I graduated with a film minor, but I was still like, just kind of riding into the void. Um, and like, I was like, this is the one thing I could control. Like, I like screenwriting, coming continues to do that and kind of see where it goes from there. And simultaneously, my dad out of nowhere maybe had some kind of like crisis with some sorts, but like, he started to have so much time. I got to call him out like that. I mean, I don't know what it's to call it good, but like, he basically started getting involved in, he, he created like a, um, a theater group in the Bay Area of like family friends and like started putting on stage productions. Um, he was like an assistant director, um, so working behind the scenes, but like, uh, it was like something he did outside of work a lot. And then he kind of transitioned into wanting to make short films. And he became like a, like a short film director and he started making these, um, these short films and malleon. So like, I would help him out on stuff, you know, here and there, I would give him advice on his like, you know, editing and stuff. I knew what he was doing and he knew that I was like, you know, obviously into film and stuff, but we talked about doing a project together for for a long time, but it never just never really happened. And then I graduated college and moved to New York and, uh, I was kind of just riding stuff on the side and figuring out what I wanted to do when he was like, Hey, I want to do a project in English for Indian Americans. I feel like we can write something together and like do a project. Um, that would be really fun. And like, you know, we could use both of our talents and like kind of just make something like really interesting. And we're both into comedy. Um, and we're both, you know, like, like, my dad's always been funny and like I've always was riding comedy too. And like, we always talked about like doing like a comedy. You were just really. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, and uh, so, so we were like, you know, let's, let's dig about doing like a sitcom of sorts, like based on like our experiences in Indian American family. It kind of started from that and then grew into the idea of these two families in the Bay Area who are from different parts of India, but like they were friends and just shit that happens. Very like life events. Um, you're telling that through a comedic lens, showing their differences as to like two different families, very different in terms of culture and language, but showing how they kind of are still find some weirdies and like help each other out through like different random conflicts that happen in their lives. Luckily by that time, my dad had kind of built out, um, like a crew of some sort, um, which was like, you know, his friends were also just these uncles and aunties and like tech and, you know, living in a Bay Area who just are really passionate about acting and really passionate about cinematography and really passionate about all these different things and how all these I'd gigs, um, who were just down to work on this for some reason. I still don't know this reason, to say why they were so down to like audition and like get cast and like spend the entire weekend's shooting with us. Yeah, surprisingly, yeah, passion goes a long way, but like, all right. Um, but that's kind of how a new normal got started, the show is called new normal, um, for, for context with the audience, but yeah, we shot a pilot, like almost three years ago, a crazy learning experience. Obviously, we just didn't really know what we were doing, which was like, let's just figure it out. Um, it was like, middle, it was, COVID was kind of tail end of COVID, but like, it was still a thing, so we were kind of like, worried about that. Like our, the very first day of our shoot, like one of our DPs got COVID, like on the morning of and yeah, figure it out on the day. Like it was, it was kind of crazy, but like we made it happen. We were very ambitious. We made it happen. And then we were like, this is actually really cool. Let's see how much more we can do. So we crowd-funded, and then raised enough money to make three more episodes. So over the next year, we were kind of just shooting. I was living in New York, so I was coming back at a time, like I would come back for a month at a time, would shoot for a month, which is basically just weekends, because everyone's working like actual jobs. And we had to like figure out like, yeah, figure out like, 10 people schedules that would all line up to be free for a whole weekend. We were shooting in my house at another house. And like it was very much a community effort, huge community effort. Like my mom was cooking, people helping out volunteers, like coming to like PA and like 80 and like all these different things on set that we just needed to do. But it was also like me and my dad wearing a million hats and like being able to figure out, okay, like logistics and like schedules and catering, like what are they going to eat? Like what do we need for the sets? Like how do we set the props and like dress the set to make it look like a house and like what should it look like? And then writing the story also is another whole thing, right? So like I'll go back to New York for a month and then we would on Zoom, like write scripts and like we had other writers help us out too and like figure out the story and then like come back and then you know, like rehearse and all these different things. So and we were like moving the equipment around everything too. So that's why I said educational because like doing all of that, like I learned so much from that experience, like doing four episodes of this was like basically my phone school completely. And really prepared me because like once you do that, it only goes up from there and like things get easier because you know how to do everything else. But that's kind of how you normal, you know what happened and what with other words I said I'm just creating. It's educational. Challenging. Yeah, challenging. It was real. Challenging and then you said, what's the word you use? Unforgivable. Invaluable. That's what you said. You said, you said, you said, you know, that was the word you used. Oh yeah, that's the word given to you. Unforgivable. It's a lignit. Yeah, all these values. Challenging in the sense that like obviously there's like so many challenges like logistically and like physically like you know, we're working with like a bunch and all these things. Also, I mean like there was obviously just like creative challenges. My dad and I are two very different people. Like we had differences in opinion on like how these would go and like you navigating that's also an interesting thing, right? Because it's like your dad also like working with you on this. Like you see them as a collaborator when you're like working on something. But also it's a good and bad thing because like you can have arguments and then like you know, you had to go down for dinner later. So it's like you got to resolve things. You can't just like leave and like do things. I can't imagine doing something like that with my dad. That's insane. Yeah, that's a really. It was a learning process. Like I could not either before doing it. And it's a lot of learning when to like where are we're both of our skills are and then trusting more another. I think every single shoot we have, we had like one very big explosive fight. But like that low knowing that like, okay, this is normal. It's fine. Like we're going to have a fight. It's okay. We're still going to make the thing. We're still going to like do it. We'll like you know, we'll figure it out. And then like knowing like where our skills are and like trusting each other to like do that. That's really kind of how it happened. But yeah, it's tough sometimes because it's like creatively like we're doing other things and like you know, sometimes you can't and like you just understand you're like okay, like where are those where where what we can do what we can't do. And that's kind of what led me to my next project too is like wanting to not have those limitations and like just do whatever I want to do. I'm just curious. Like what's an example of like a creative conflict? I think like, I mean, so it's comedy, right? And like comedy is like very subjective. Yeah. And my dad and I are from very different generations obviously, right? So we have different ideas of what's funny and what isn't. And like sometimes it's like it's you spend like time writing a joke and like you write this thing you think is really funny. And then I send my dad and he's like I don't get this like this is making me sad. What you mean? This isn't funny. And then or like it's like understanding like queer audiences. I think that's an important thing when you write something is who are you writing this for? You get to kind of remind ourselves of that constantly because sometimes we would write a joke that we would get. But then my dad would be like, oh, someone in India watching this is not going to get it. So we have to explain the joke as we were like like in the dialogue we had to like make it clear with the joke is with them. But then I would be like that just you know ruins the comedy part of it like deciding making those decisions where it's like okay, like some people are not going to get this but that's fine because the quality of the joke is going to decrease if we try to explain it for everybody. I mean like it won't hit as well for this audience and it may not hit at all but like it'll be a better joke, right? So like those kind of things yeah, those are like the main differences. I feel like sometimes and like yeah, but like you know you figure it out. I think with a sitcom especially it's like the story is king you can do whatever you want cinematically but it doesn't that doesn't matter as much as the writing. So we would always put a lot of time with like making sure that the writing was taught not just and then like that's something learned over time as we did like the making it so it's writing and pacing is the most important thing. Yeah. I just think it's so cool that you guys did this. I feel like I get so excited when like someone I know is like making something you know like creating art for people to and like relate to. I remember when it came out I was like I was like showing my friend I was like yo that's my buddy. That's my boy. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I mean it means the world. Because like you spend so much time making something and like you sometimes forget you're like okay why are we even doing this? Like who's gonna watch this and then you hear something like that where like people are actually watching it but other people and that's when you're like oh this is what I made it. Yeah. It's very easy to get in your head about those are things sometimes when you really just have to trust like if I find this process interesting and I find this thing I'm working on interesting you just need to trust other people are also gonna find value in it and like find it exciting. Yeah exactly. Yeah. It's also like not about the amount of music gets. Yeah. Yeah. Like that got kind of stuff and getting monetized or whatever like we just put it on YouTube after it was done because this is the way that the most people are gonna be able to see it. If we tried to go on stream and pop from around I mean that's also just another very complicated process and difficult process but like we were like let's just put it out there we've been talking like it for so long. This is to it. And I mean who knows like it could blow up like 30 years from now you know. You have no freaking idea. The start of an year's genre. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. If they're not too good. I really liked about it too. Like I feel like the conversation was felt real. Real situations. Real it kind of also I mean I watched it a long time ago so I don't remember exactly but I feel like there was an element of like surprise too if I'm not mistaken. I feel like was there was there something about an affair at some point or no. No spoilers. We there was no affair but like we always it was like a running joke that like the dad and one of the families and like the mom and the other family were like they were the college friends which is why like how we each other but like there was always like a kind of a weird like energy between them. Yeah. That like the other spouses would always be like like what the fuck's going on. But like it was never yeah I mean this is a family show you know like it's a we have a little too spicy. But that was memorable is what I was trying to say because I remembered that energy I was like that spicy. Yeah. Yeah. Not just saying it. We honestly have spicy we had some spicy jokes in there. I remember right now. Yeah. But yeah I think basically what I liked a lot was the realism. I feel like I think that's what gets me that's a reason I like movies with a lot of dialogues. Even like a pulp fiction. I just I just really enjoy like just watch it like hot. Yeah. Your entire apartment is a pulp fiction like D-Core. I think there's two no I love that movie. Yeah. By the way like it's like I watched it like I think in middle school and it like changed my life like I think I literally got into screwing it because of it like probably because of that movie but yeah it's an incredible movie but yeah I see I was just really funny. I know if I would call the dialogue realistic though I feel like it's very like stylized but like that's what makes it fun. Yeah style I think it is stylized but it is I think it is very it's like a very like mundane kind of conversations but made stylized to the point where it's like oh this is interesting to watch like oh yeah it is your real conversations yeah yeah I feel like the characters are definitely like slightly unhinged in their own ways. Yeah yeah but the conversation that they're having from their perspective seems pretty real. Yeah I guess I can see that like given the character given the character exactly. Yeah. I just watched this movie last week the Jesse Eisenberg movie a real pain. Oh real pain. Love that movie. Yeah that was really good too. I feel like a real yeah very real emotions dialogue it was like it was like yeah the script is great. Yeah yeah it was like and like I was I listened to like a podcast with Karen Culkin and like where they're interviewing him and like it's kind of crazy like he would talk about how he doesn't really like prep that much. He's really good at memorizing a lot of dialogue because he's just growing up as an actor so he would just show up to set read the lines like right before he'd go up and shoot it and like Jesse Eisenberg is the opposite right we're I mean it's kind of like their character in the movie but like in real life where he would be very very neurotic and he was also directing the movie and he wrote it so he was just like very particular about things. Karen Culkin would just show up but like not really knowing where like where even they were going like he would just like not knowing what scene they were going to do and you just show up read the lines really quick and just like be himself and do it and then the key one to Oscar right so like like this just like shows how real I mean also a town that he is but like how real that script was great. Do you feel like there's anything like you learn to creatively that you didn't expect? Oh yeah um like before doing new normal I never even really saw myself as a director that idea just seemed very inachievable because it's like involved so much more and I found that skill will come very natural to me when I we were doing normal like I don't even remember like started to do it uh let me get the first episode but like it kind of just like happened and that's when I was like oh I think this is like I can see what the edits gonna look like as we were shooting in like that's such an important skill to have if you like so um doing that but also like creatively like I think working with actors is also like what I learned a lot um yeah knowing the right decision is to make as you're doing more takes or like making sure that you you don't you can always think to the future and be like I'm I gonna regret this in like six months or now when I watch this this this don't do this one thing because I don't want to do another retake and take everyone's time to do not do do another take on this um like balancing that right because like I I feel like that's like some of us are like just like people please just right like you don't want to make everyone do another take and like have to reset and do the same lines like for the eighth time but if there's like a thing in there I think that like it's gonna bother me sticks from for now like I'd rather just do that now and tell myself to hey it's okay everyone's here for this reason so like we should be doing this uh that's a less honor because there was so many times like I watch the episodes and like I'm like damn I wish we did that one more time or like we we we we we messed this thing up I mean not that I didn't want to probably notice this but it's just like a first-school thing um and then like thinking back to the end and like really wanted to take that long it is you again like we can just do it again um so yeah definitely I feel like for me I have like no shame about those things I was like you know what you signed up for bitch this is my shit yeah yeah yeah you should that's how it should be but the whole thing is it's like these are all volunteers like they're all doing yeah yeah yeah and then it's then it's always that guilt feeling of like oh like I'm keeping everyone's time here like I need to like be yeah which is like yeah here it's different way that people are it's your family and people are doing it for free no no I mean I'm just saying I'm joking obviously I yeah yeah and it's like but that's maybe kind of to an extent yeah you can be that bitch in that asshole but that's going to affect the environment of the whole set right so that's also going to bleed into like how the actors work so there's always like a given take balance and you can also be nice about like hey like we should do a more take you know just yeah instead of being like that was you you do it again go full Kubrick 100 exactly yeah exactly yeah like like emotionally abuser cast yeah always a great idea that's like stuff you only learn by doing right exactly yeah that is the best film school is just doing making stuff that is like the best film school I haven't gone to film school so actually I don't know but like no basis is like that's also that's also I'm assuming why add film school like like you make a lot of things in film school right like you go to classes here like most of it is like making stuff I think this is the best film school because it's a lot less expensive so yeah I mean there is definitely like a I think like a like valuable aspect to the fact that like you're getting feedback from like professionals who have been doing it for a while so they can give you more like and it's I think the the biggest value you get from post-school is the is the community and like is like being around and like the people you meet like 100% yeah it's much harder to do that outside of that but yeah it's just business school for film basically literally yeah like the film is like also it forces you to make stuff like it forces you to like do reps and like you know figure out what you're ines isn't like you know do a lot of stuff and like um that when you graduate you've already done like a bunch of stuff so right so okay here's taking a bunch of notes because he's he's writing are you writing your script now for yes yes I mean I have I was actually writing a script like before the breakup and all that happened uh so it's been on the back burner but I'm definitely like taking notes like tips for later yeah man I know yeah and there's like a million things online to like high-ride great script like like this structure and all that stuff like yeah um but yeah honestly the best way the best motivation for writing a script is going to go through something like a breakup so yeah so yeah I mean that's what it is right I feel like how much of this do you feel like is just expression the like is it like an expression of what's inside or is it just you're writing something for an audience you know uh it depends on what you choose to do right like but I think like uh uh there is definitely a piece of you whenever you write like somehow even if it's like the first like full-screen play I wrote was like like a action stoner comedy which is like a true reflection of your soul yeah which is like like I don't know like it's like a ridiculous story but like there is like at the core of it it's about like I I mean like I don't know the aspect of it but like it's like these two characters and like I mean I there is like at the chorus but like the emotional kind of arc this this character goes through like it's somewhat of a parallel right of like what I believe and like people always say like write with right what you know like because you're your experience and your voice is the most unique thing you can write um so so yes like there's ways you can put that in like different genres new normal we wrote a lot of comedy for an audience but like it's based on our personal experiences a lot of the jokes that we wrote were like things that like happened to us um so so yeah and then like my the next part did show time like short film like it's about a the main character's female she's a singer like I am not their female nor a singer but like the the the the core like the arc she goes through is very similar it's based on like my experiences so like yeah like there is like a there is a piece of myself in the end and I think it's always gonna be your reflection yeah well since you've brought it up let's talk about it let's talk about your you know your big your short film just call show time right you're plugging yeah I don't know what I'm plugging it for like it's like it's like like you can go see it now like yeah you one day I know we need to build the hype so it's in it's in what pros production stage right now what do you have a release date in mind what's going on uh don't you say behind uh I don't know uh when it's gonna be released like publicly because like the idea with this is like once we're finished like which I think post will be done in a couple weeks for now which is exciting because like now we're going through that late fun process of like kind of really really putting the finishing touches on it but um but once it's done like I want to put it in festivals uh and like see how it kind of do that run and see if it like gets it anywhere in place anywhere so it's complicated like being able to release that publicly because a lot of places like you can't actually release the film publicly the actual premiere as if you get the festival itself what festival are you submitting into oh you know just like uh can Sundance you know there are some like really really great South Asian film festivals across the US um I'll submit to to to those actually like one of the largest ones this year is based in Seattle I don't know if you get into that here but like or we're here to it but like um uh that would be a great film to play uh I mean a great festival to play uh I think uh it really depends on like I think once we see how it comes out uh kind of assessment the quality of it and then like making it like festival is like okay like what do we think we can probably get into it and like where what was some reach ones be just to like apply to say hey I apply to this and like you know it's a low chance to get in but like whatever so I definitely want to play in New York I think like I live there it's very much like a film those made in New York New York's part of that all the self-cost money too so it's like yeah balancing like how many festivals make sense to apply to like there's also a millions of festivals and some of them are like not as valuable as other ones yeah ones I can actually go to as well a probably more valuable like physically because that's kind of the point of festivals is to like meet people there and like you're like you know network and stuff like that so yeah I don't know but that's a problem I'm gonna figure out once we finish the film yeah what's well across that bridge you want to get there so why do they so why do they do this thing where you can't really sit publicly until you enter the festival like what is the reasoning so yeah I mean some festivals like they would prefer that like you premiere at their festival so they can say that oh this is like a this premiere to add you know that's your interest right so like if you release it publicly before that then it's like they're thinking is that like less people will come to see it because already online there's also element of like distribution because sometimes like running at festivals like you start creating deals with distribution companies so it's like it makes it messy if you're like already releasing it into like theaters and stuff I know that's the case with with with feature films a lot yeah yeah short films is short films are kind of funny because it's like yeah there's no ROI on short films like you are gonna just the much money and make this thing and you're not gonna make that money back like 99% like we not but like it's like a you know it's your portfolio it's like you're building your network you're building like you know what you're getting noticed yeah again you know and then meeting people who can then potentially fund your yet feature film or extra or whatever yeah so kind of a left turn like from the questions we've been asking but you mentioned you were wanted to submit to like a South Asian film festivals specifically and obviously like there's an aspect for like your South Asian filmmaker so you're submitting that reason but I'm just curious like do you see the short film as in any way like representative of your experiences specifically as a South Asian because like it sounds like the new normal was at least like somewhat rooted in that like uniquely in terms of like the I guess like value or like what yeah the narrative of that so that's a great question that's a really good question um and I think no like yes the main character in this short film is South Asian and there's I guess an element of it with her mom and how I don't want to get away too much but like I wouldn't say that the story is like a Asian story yeah no spoilers you gotta go see it we're we're but like um the story isn't a South Asian story like it's not yeah that's not what it is it's not like it's not like it's very different from new normal in that sense yeah it's confusing and that are what people can relate to if you are that kind of character who um will the main character in this short film it's it's sort of about like how she's balancing this like 95 corporate job and like her dreams to be a singer like a New York and the chaos that that brainstorms her life and like what kind of leads her to like realize what paths you should be on it's not about like her being a South Asian singer or in her experience like that it's more about like yeah um so but I guess like the the idea of uh South Asian film festivals is that one they they do generally do look out for um a content like this that are putting South Asian people at the forefront and like are made by South Asian people and and generally that just like you know it does increase your chances of being able to play there because yeah yeah I'm like that and also like a lot of the community that I like I've built in New York uh like the film community that and like people who have mentored me are from that South Asian filmmaker space like there's a conversation called Rickshaw which I'm just out of Rickshaw at the film foundation like they are a film foundation that is that is run and created by South Asians force South Asians and I think that that community is so open because it's so it's it's pretty small it's it's growing a lot but it's relatively small and like them being so welcoming to someone like me coming into this and like finding other people like myself who are also making content and like I'm trying to like figure out this filmmaking thing they help me like literally make this thing happen you see like your South Asian identity as central to like anything you're trying to express or like your creative impulses at all or do you see it as more something that sometimes intersects but like you wouldn't really say is core to like your thinking or expression I would say more than that or like I just do our is it I want to tell and like the things that I'm writing it's not it's not necessarily about what is it like to be a South Asian like could it be yes but I think my idea of representation is like having a regular story be told but starting a South Asian person isn't necessarily have to be about oh why I'm like Indian or Pakistani or whatever like it it's just about like having them on screen and like having them be told like I think like the UK does it super well already and like they're like you know you the UK like obviously has this like controversy and then like she thinks city history and like city food as well but in terms of film they're kind of killing it they they got it down to some extent because like if you watch the content coming out of there like it's so diverse and it's like not about like oh being an Indian in UK it's like just like it's like a detective show but like main detective's Indian and like yeah they think like that right so then the not that there's anything wrong with like stories that are about being Indian American obviously like yeah I'm just going to show based on that but like the most of stories I will tell will be like the latter that's good I feel like we need less you know content where it's just like kind of pandering to an audience I just watched the first episode of um that one new Indian show on Hulu I forgot what it was called jelly boys jelly boy yeah yeah and you know I appreciate what they're trying to do I get it I just like again like it just feels so in ontetic sometimes where it's just like oh the the chicken tikka and the you know all that stuff and it's just like yeah that's what so okay that's really yeah like it's just like it's a show made for white people you know I've realized so what I realized is that like like I used to feel the same way about media that's like you know made for what like like obviously this the whole like never ever like you know right yeah and the discussion on that show right yeah I wasn't really a fan of it right but I realized that there are people out there who really enjoy the show that like what I felt as some kind of wear it's like okay like this is a silly really goofy show the humor isn't really for me some things I was laughing at but mostly I was like it's not really for me but there is a brown audience out there that actually does enjoy it it's just not us I think that like it really defines on where you came from and like what you're what's available to you so like for that reason like I've started to appreciate the kind of content more like before I was like oh never have ever like you know it's just this is the regular like it it set us back while a lot it means we'll never recover from this yeah literally yeah like like what did I realize I was like I should that's that's that's stupid because like one it's a show featuring a brown person on screen that's another that's that's that itself is a win and of itself and two there are brown people in America who really like that show who really think it's like great and it's represent and Mindy Kaling wrote that show because it's based on her experience now her experience of being brown versus in America versus our experience in being brown America like us you're from being from the Bay Area where we were surrounded by brown people like like you know like that's a very different experience than other brown people in the US and like I only realized that after like you know you kind of leave and like you meet more people who are not in the bay and you're like oh like you're you're you're you're kind of different like you did like not a bad way but it's just like your experience was different and like yeah to dumb that may be more relatable you know it's working for somebody like even bad content that's featuring people is barely like the worst like quote-unquote bad is subjective right but like yeah um uh but like you know like it's on the side of the worst thing in the world right it's like it's fine no for sure I mean and I agree with you I feel like the more I've talked to people the more I've kind of realized that that's what I'm saying like I appreciate what they're doing yeah like I appreciate their content maybe it's not for me but yeah it's like it's the same the minicailing thing that you're talking about right the Bianca Chopra right like it's the no you do you bucket that differently no I'm just joking I don't like but you know that's no well but but the argument was the same right it was oh she set us back you know oh this is not what people go through this is yeah but you're right there's an audience that appreciate it and you have to respect that um and it's like our job to to make stuff that's like well that's that's waitable for us right like yeah yeah being brown from an area in America where it's like very very like a very much like a brown community it's such a different experience and like I haven't seen that as much on screen as I have the other right like the opposite so like I feel like it'd be very like I want to work on like I mean this idea that I've had for like some of the future wishes like about that specifically like what is it like being a brown person living in a predominantly brown neighborhood in America yeah I think like at the end of the day the issue isn't with any of these like shows or anything it's really just the lack of a diversity of brown voices and brown perspectives because I feel like normally we talk about it as like this homogenous thing where it's just like oh stories about brown people but there's so much particularity and like the different experiences that people have and also in terms of like the actual complexity of the stories being told because it's like if you look at something like everything everywhere all at once for example in terms of like uh East Asian like the culture like even there like there is like an engagement with things like generational trauma that usually isn't there I feel like in a lot of brown stories for example so it's a both like a complexity issue both in terms of like depth in the sorts of issues being discussed and also like again like the different brown perspectives not 100 percent I will say that is changing a lot though like I feel like there's a lot of content out there especially on like Netflix and Prime not shot here honestly not shot here at all but shot in India where it's like a lot more real yeah I remember watching sacred games oh I don't know if you guys know sacred games but when that when that show came out I was like wow I finally see something where this is how people actually fucking talk you know yeah oh real I was just so happy and then since then there've been a string of shows that come that have come out in the similar yeah no yeah Netflix yeah Netflix and I mean I heard recently there's like more kind of controversy around the kind of content that Netflix India is making but like there was a long string of time where like they're just pumping out like great content and I've heard and I don't know how true this is but like it's because like the the people making like series content uh for streaming is very different from like the traditional like Bollywood like families of like either all independent creators like making yeah I could talk about like how South India like killed it for like forever like it's kind of insane um obviously biased to Kerala but like they destroy the game like and it comes to filmmaking making like independent films and like getting that to the mainstream audience um and having it click and actually make money to the point where like big budget stars from like the Resmiqons and like not resmiqon but like the Resmiqon of Kerala's uh like are now just like focusing on making like indie films because they're making money and they're focused on story not on like scale which is which is insane so I think that's like it's really sick and then Bollywood started to kind of like learn from that and then taking his turn yeah there's a lot of good there's so many good Millie films coming out oh yeah it's insane it's like actually crazy I don't know how to watch all we imagine as light I saw that yes yeah yeah yeah that's a very yeah very indie very indie film but yeah yeah I like that's there for sure I was talking more about like the Kerala film industry like okay yeah though it's kind of but like yes yeah same thing right like like mainstream you're talking about mainstream yeah like there are still like the mainstream like masala movies that are being made it's less so before that's still there but like a lot of um you know big Kerala like movie star then this is this is the case across like India as well not just Kerala but like I think I feel like it's hard to kind of make Kerala was like these bigger stars that were used to do a lot more mishaw movies now shifted towards making indie films and star-rating films that are like much smaller budget much smaller scale because like audiences were going to see them and they were making money off of them and like they realized that like oh actually having a good story can be profitable and so it's like who would have thought right so so um and and it was just like the quality was just insane like it's ridiculous yeah I feel like if I knew more about West Bengal like there would be an interesting yeah addition to add there because for example like like the first Indian films to get like win Oscars were from West Bengal be up with trilogy for example the Bengali like film industry was one of the earliest to get like artistic recognition from the West especially obviously because of like get the British Empire and how like Kulkkatha was like the capital of the administration but I don't know enough about Bengal to come in further than you do I either do I by doing they got some good though yeah I wonder what's coming between West Bengal and Kerala that's the one thing that's come there are two things actually fish and capitalism oh yeah I forgot about the fish but you're right crazy how educating the population do that yeah who to thought right you know woke fucks make good money dance they made the films work oh man but going back to where we started to go back to show time like just to close that off I feel like everyone's eagerly waiting for like that's well that's all I'm going to say I know literally everybody yeah like holy said I remember I remember like not to sell it more but I remember when you sent me the script for that to just like give it a read again what stood out to me was the realism you know like the dialogue the way the characters change the the way like perceptions of them change like they look at each other differently as a story goes on you know like and I feel like the audience perceives them in a different way too so I just very interesting very good stuff thank you man I feel like the script has probably changed the shit ton from when I last sent you well I'm excited too then yeah that is also that is also a lesson I guess you know what it's like you're always going to be like the script is never done like it's all like to the minute yeah you shoot it it's going to be changing so like be okay with that and like be open to changing and no one to change when not to change but yeah I think the realism like probably this came from like I mean this is very much based on like my experience like it's about somebody you know trying to decide like what quote unquote life path they should be on realizing that there isn't really a path and that's very much just like going to college and getting a career in tech and like having to figure out okay like well I want to be a filmmaker though so like am I allowed to be a filmmaker like am I like is that a thing I can do because I had to go to film school and I do I need a license yeah doing it a life yeah the license and just like having those like intrinsic thinking of like to do it like I was being my own worst enemy and as I started to kind of like get deeper into filmmaking going to these events and like after making you normal and I was going to like use kind of like networking events and stuff you would introduce yourself to people sometimes right and you'd be like well like I work in tech but I also like make films instead of just calling yourself a filmmaker right that was also like the thing I was thinking it was why can't I just call myself a filmmaker like I am yeah I am one and like I've made some stuff and if I don't call myself a filmmaker who who else is going to like no one's ever gonna do that unless I do it first right so that's something that that's something that that's a film explorer's right so this of this main character like struggling to call herself an artist or a singer because she's like doesn't feel like a legit one because she you know isn't doing this full-time but yeah that's kind of why the realism came out so when you say like you almost had that mental block about oh like can I be a filmmaker even though I didn't go to film school where do you think that block came from like was it a skill thing or like yeah um I don't even think it was a skill thing it was more so like am I supposed to be one right like I don't do this full-time I'm gonna spend every day you know writing and directing our on-sets now you and I presented my friends are like not filmmakers like they're in tech or you know in that school or whatever and and doing something a lot more stable so like you're not surrounded by that and also it's like thinking like what's my life gonna be like I went to college and my parents paid a lot of money for me to go to college and I have student loans and stuff it's like the idea of I'm not in that tax bracket where I can just be fucking around and doing whatever I want and not make money and just like pursuing a creative passion which is maybe true or false right but like regardless of that like that shouldn't stop you from being able to call yourself what you want to be right or what you are doing leaving college also it's just like if you're in a whole new fucking world right like yeah I'm in New York and just getting new people and like you understand that you can kind of you start to realize oh I can do whatever I want you have so much time and you have financial resources to do so as well right so why can't I just pursue what I want to do while doing how much of it do you think is almost like the identity part of it in terms being a filmmaker versus like the activity not feeling like you could act on it I would say I mean uh I think it's more something the identity part of it um because like initially when I started off right like I didn't I thought I was the only person who was working in tech and trying to be a filmmaker ridiculous idea because I obviously met many many more people doing the same thing but like initially you feel very alone because you think that if you want to be a filmmaker like I have to be doing this all the time yeah I have to be grinding and having sleepless nights in uh just like slidding away at sets all the time because that's what you got to do to to make it but you quickly realize that that's not the case and also you realize that the best way of learning is by doing it and putting yourself out there like whenever making you normal a big mental block I did over also was being not afraid to put my stuff out there and watch it like I couldn't watch the episodes with people everyone I knew was like you know I was working on this thing and they were so excited for it so supportive I wish when you finish an episode I'll go back to New York and we get to watch it we get to watch it and they'll get together and I would literally hide in the back covered in sweat because I was just embarrassed of showing this stuff off yeah and I realized after was I was like that's so ridiculous let's so stupid if you spend so much time and effort making something you can't even watch it with people that who are supporting you uh because you think you're gonna judge you that's something that I learned to get over and it's also a part of what I kind of put it to show time as well like this main character she meets this like funny enough these she meets this like podcast bro like tiktok dude who's like kind of yeah I mean I don't know he's not like he's not like he's very much a meme like he's he's kind of like that meme-y like brown fuck boy a kind of character um but like my my idea with having that character in there was not necessarily just to laugh at him but because it helps her realize as cringy as this guy is on the outside seems like this archetype of guy become all laugh at deep down there is something you gotta kind of admire about him being able to put himself out there and not really give a shit about well and like at the end of the thing like she kind of learned something from him yeah unless like you're making a podcast about something toxic or something that's like actually like negatively impacting people like yeah you should not do that you should stop doing that but like yeah if you're making a podcast and it's just maybe like people laugh at it or like cringy but you're putting yourself out there and you're creating something that youbraven up to put it out there like that's much more than a equal consent right so i think that's something that's very very renewable and it's similar to like it's kind of what I helped me realize also like if there's people like putting out all this shit content on tiktok like an i'll be proud of like think that I spent time and effort and I think is better of uh for that right yeah the assumption is this man is an erudimable human being just because- no no the idea is that he isn't like he is he is very much. Oh, because I love the starting essential. There are a lot of those like cringe fuck boys who make content that are like literally like you are negatively impacting people by making like that is bad you should stop. Yeah. You should know you should know what to give you a mic but but yeah there are all those cringe like boys who are just like yeah you're kind of crazy but yeah you're pretty is all about there. It's fun like you would probably be like we want to be like right like who cares yeah yeah yeah I respect you forget even even the even the content creators. I want to know who are the people who leave comments on these videos that get like 12,000 20,000 60,000 likes how to like who are you really good question. I should do a segment on these people. Yeah. Yeah. That maybe that maybe that goes back to our whole thing about like how like some stuff isn't just made for us and like there's like audiences out there because yeah clearly like they're getting viewed they're getting likes they're getting comments like some fuckers watching this so like so like I guess they're just watching and like you know what good for you man. If you put a comment that gets 60,000 like do you get monetized for that do they give you anything. Oh no no no I don't think so no no no no no no no I think it's like I'm talking about the guy making content. No no I understand what you're saying. I'm just still fascinated with the comment. Yeah right yeah. It's just like a cloud I guess like honestly I expect it. It's like that's their passion. It's getting clouded up like because you really have to you go you have to go in there and do it as soon as the video drops before like reaches people anyway. Yeah crazy. I think that's the different generation. I think that's like a good thing in different generations. I think we're we we're out of that I don't know we're past it. Yeah. No I definitely think it's a type of person thing. I definitely think their motherfuckers out there still like notifications on ready to go soon as something drops. But yeah I going back to kind of the thing you were talking about but the identity like calling yourself an artist, a director, film producer, whatever. I was literally having this I don't know if you remember but we were having this conversation in December at your place. It's like it's a simple thing right like when you go introduce yourself like okay what do you do right I'm an engineer and then like a part of me just dies when I say that because it's like I don't feel like it's true you know like I don't that's not what I identify as but I say it anyways and then another thing is like if I say okay I'm a podcaster then I feel fake and I just feel like yeah you're gonna start asking for receipts. Yeah no that's like dude exactly exactly what I'm going through like it's the same thing I saw to this day I started with it it's like the go meet new people and they ask where I do and then I'm like first of all I can just bullshit job solution consulting like what does that even mean and then it's so hard for me to bring up that oh I'm but I'm also a filmmaker yeah and cuz like because then then you're gonna be like oh like okay filmmaker sure like we know yeah that's what I'm thinking like obviously they're not gonna do that but like you have this idea in your head that you're not valued enough to call yourself that which is ridiculous and I literally made a whole short film about it and I still struggle to do that so so there's so much to my feel like you know like if I said because if I said oh yeah I'm a podcaster they'll be like in my head they'll be like oh wow there's another brown boy who has a podcast and you know he also wants to make music on the side and once he I feel like okay another one of those people yeah I'm just a software engineer fuck it would you the trope yeah also yeah that's that's that's tough yeah that's what it's like I definitely know that stigma 100% but I also feel like that's completely internal I do not think like a single person the vast majority of people at least will never like think about you in the podcast thing is actually really really sick because like yes there is some sort of a trope of like a negative plantation that comes up brown boy having a podcast but also like also like how many people like do you know on your immediate circle who are actively running this podcast you're on season two right now you're continuously producing content and it's like if you can prove to people that like hey this is a podcast is actually good and like you're you're producing content that's like not negatively impacting people and just talking bullshit about other things you know like that's huge flex and I think that's like that's what you kind of got yeah do rely on it I think that's the thing that to tell myself also it's like yeah people are gonna have this maybe maybe have this image but then like if they decide to go and like listen to it or watch your film whatever right don't realize like oh this guy's for real the work will talk for itself exactly yeah exactly yeah I think I I realize yeah a lot of this self stigma like not they would call myself a filmmaker it was like really with my friends and like close ones who started to bring this up for me but when we meet new people and like I would be like oh like you know like searching this on whatever and like and then other people will be forced to bring up I love that your voice drops every time you say your job I think we get let the record stay I actually do like my job my job is fine it's great like I I would not leave it but like yeah I don't be I genuinely do because it lets me do what I love like it lets me make yeah I have like great work life balance and it's challenging but like it's rewarding and like also yeah I can comfortably fun like so show time I mostly funded it all out of my own pocket because I was able to because I have a job so I can't not bet at all but like like they have a mutual friend on me good like she would often tell people for me like oh he's also filmmaker and I was like why can't I just hit this myself like that that's what that's what I kind of learned like be more upfront about who we are and just like who gives a fuck what other people think like sure like you were actually making things you're making your recording podcast episodes so like you should call me the call yourself a pastor right like no 100% I think kind of the last thing I want to touch on is you know at the heart of it what it comes down to is like a lot of people just don't know how to express themselves right because if you did yeah you would create some for you and that doesn't mean you have to be a director or a podcaster or a painter it can be engineering you know if that's what it's giving you you know that's what you're really passionate about and you can build a rocket right but like a lot of people have jobs that don't do that for them and they're too afraid of you know dabbling into doing anything creative because what's the point like either they don't not express themselves or they're scared of imperfection wasted energy wasted time where it's like oh what's the point if I don't make it in this right yeah and what do you have to say to inspire people do you have anything that's tough because I feel like I'm in that same boat where it's like I don't know if I can inspire anybody that I haven't made it and like I you've inspired me bro I'll say that okay well I appreciate that I mean that that's that's something that's something but yeah there's always that thought that's also another thing where like I a reason why I struggle to tell people that is because like what if this is just like a thing I don't achieve oh like what is the idea of success in the first place right of like making it we're talking with this earlier like I think redefining what your idea of success is one thing people have this idea of like being a successful like filmmaker is you know being those big name directors who like everybody knows and you make a ton money and your famous and like you can never have to worry about like making your films or whatever you can make whatever you want and having an unlimited budget I think that yes like there's obviously a lot of benefits that comes with that yeah I would love to be that one day but I think I'm still successful if I'm continuously able to give what to tell us always that I want to tell whether that means still working at Adobe and doing that at the same time um and just constantly growing in my craft making figure scale projects and like doing the parts that I want to do that is self-accessible right so no I will actually say that as someone who I think like I've always been interested in writing and like oh making and stuff but it took me a long time to like really get into it in like a consistent way because I think for me I didn't really realize the joy and value of the pure active expression I would always think about it in terms of like oh I need to achieve something like I need to have like a short film done or I have to have like a work done to a certain level of quality and I feel like there is something to be said about just experimenting with something like when you have that itch and like through practice like developing that like understanding of like oh like there is something deeply and truly valuable about the active expression in itself and I would say to anyone like listening like if there's something that has been on the back of your mind that you've always wanted to do and like maybe you thought you couldn't put in the proper amount of time to like fully accomplish it or anything like that I do think that even if you're not sure if that's what you're passionate about that itch is there for a reason there's a reason you feel driven to do that thing and not like a million other things that you could be doing in the world and there's something to be said for just throwing yourself into it and just seeing if you can get something valuable out of it worst case you haven't really wasted that much time or anything right it's not like there's some huge commitment but in the best case you've found something that will add value and joy for your life for the rest of you right so yeah I do really like recommend tri-things out it's also like I mean just like scientifically it's been shown that a passion isn't something you have a passion is something that also develops through practice so there is like an extent to which like you can never truly be passionate about something until you engage with it and develop that yeah it's a journey right like you're maybe this isn't the exact thing you want to do especially like but like it very well could help you figure out what that is by just like trying it and like yeah exactly yeah and like I think there's a huge value in reflection like you always should be looking back and like be mindful of what your journey is because yeah like when I go back and like watch you normal and like I'm watching you know cuts of my film right now like I can see my growth and like you you only can have that if you start somewhere right and you just start doing it so yeah like you know make that podcast make that song like regardless of like whether or not that ends up being your passion like at the end of the day you will definitely learn something about yourself even if it's like I definitely don't want to do this should ever again yeah like it's really like I hear what you said about like learn how to enjoy the journey the process you know of going through it yes is being results oriented I feel like that's been the biggest change in my life personally is like even like when I started learning guitar at the age of 13 or 14 whatever like it was always oh I just want to learn how to play the song and I didn't want to I didn't care about any theory I didn't care about like how to get there give me all the tools I need to play the song that's it that's how I kind of approached a lot of things in my life basically anything I did was with that same approach whether it was art or the school or whatever changing that to just how do you enjoy the process how are you not miserable during the process yeah instead of being having such a tunnel of fun and only looking at at the end of it yeah no I 100% like feel the same way where it's like I'm still learning to like do that properly seeing like the steps I need to take to achieve a goal not as like an obligation but as an opportunity to like enjoy like the hopeful process and like gain something out of it good stuff guys cool all right then I guess that's time thank you again for joining us I had fun yeah I don't know yeah I know we might my agent's getting mad at me who like I like you know kind of running the whiskey yeah yeah yeah he can't get the crowd solutions
