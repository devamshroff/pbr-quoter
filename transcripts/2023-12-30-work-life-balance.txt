 Everyone, welcome back to Pineapple Blend Rotation. Since we've been really bad at giving proper intro, we're going to do that this time and we're going to do it every time to explain what we're doing. So we are mental health focus podcasts where the goal is to share experiences and start discussions. We want to reiterate that we're not experts. The point is to just share what we've learned through our journeys and talk to each other, get tips from each other and share that and engage with the audience. Dan, that intro was already like 100 times better than the last one. I also want to mention that we have an Instagram page and that's where we're going to be posting a lot of content, a lot of questions that we ask the audience and get responses from. That's where we'll have our main engagement with everyone. So please go follow our Instagram page. It's Pineapple Blend Rotation. Okay. So here, what's been going on since the last time we talked? What has been going on? Honestly, not that much of note, which is honestly pretty notable for the last few months. I feel like after this whole period of like, like I mentioned last episode, my girlfriend moving in with me and us getting settled together, we're finally starting to dig down and get our routines back in order. Like, just go back to normal life instead of just a state of constant chaos of like, oh, what's going on here? Trying to figure out how to live together and stuff like that. So not much has happened. I think mainly just like dialing down on those. I've been trying to work on improving my sleep these last few weeks. So I have been trying to get a bed before four, which is such a low bar for most people, but such a high bar for me. So definite progress. Yeah, just slowly with withling away at it. So how has that been though? How is that like living with your girlfriend? This is the first time you're moved in together? That's a big step. Oh, definitely. Yeah. It's been going well. I think like at the beginning, they were definitely like some like arguments and challenges that we had to work through. Just because like, obviously like in the past, like, I mean, I would stay over at her place all the time, just for like, like essentially like mainly staying at her place for like weeks when we were living in college. But first of all, it's been like, like two years since we graduated, right? And then also, I think that in the past, like when we were visiting each other and like even when we were like staying together, like there was very much still a sense that like each of our apartments was our own space. So it was like, like, obviously if we had problems with what the other person was doing, it was just like, oh, like they're going to be gone. Like in a couple of days, like it's not like a big deal, whatever. And so I feel like there's been this period of like trying to negotiate that and just being like, okay, like what where do our like living habits, like like coincide, where do they not like what kind of compromises is each of us have to make? So like there were definitely like so a lot of like discussions and arguments at first. But like, yeah, I think it sort of like comes with the course. And yeah, yeah. So it's been going a lot better now, but yeah, definitely like that hunt to get over in the first place. But I mean, I've been enjoying it a lot. Yeah, it's just like so nice for me to like just come home every day and like always have her there. So I mean, no regrets from I am. That's amazing, man. I'm happy for you guys. But yeah, no, it is definitely challenging, right? Like, yeah, yeah. Transitioning to roommates and making sure each of you have this space to express yourself and grow. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. No, for those of you who don't, you didn't understand that bit like me here and I were living together in Seattle. And I moved out and asha is girlfriend moved in. And so she she replaced me. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, no, I mean that kind of leads me to my update. Like I I ended up moving to New York last month. And it's been it's been a lot of fun so far. I think I was really looking forward to this move for a while. And because I just kind of wanted to blow up my life and you know, meet a bunch of new people and kind of get lost in the city and kind of just let go of everything and start fresh. And I think it's been it's a perfect place to do it. I'm getting settled in. I'm like visiting the local spots for the first time every weekend. Like, but it's been it's been a lot of fun. You know, I never thought I would move to New York, but now I feel like they're very few cities like New York. It's it's not really comparable to Seattle or San Francisco. It's just like a different kind of place. Like it's not even a fair comparison. Yeah, just so much going on in every corner. It's so lively. It's so accessible like. Yeah, it's a different world. Yeah, I feel like it's not comparable to any city. It's the same thing. What are your what are the best spots you've been to so far? Do there's this. There's this place called Raudi Rooster. It's a place in East Village. Like very close to where I live. And it's it's an Indian fried chicken sandwich. And it's so good. Oh my god. I've had like I've literally had it like eight times in the last month. It's really good. I have to write that down for the next time on my least. That sounds beautiful. What was it called? Raudi Rooster. But no, man, there's there's a lot of there's a lot of good food. I live in East Village. So like the heart of East Village. And so like there's so many restaurants around here. Like all the main bars. Clubs are all here and then lower east side. So it's a fun neighborhood. Yeah. I feel like. Yeah, like it's probably I guess like that's just the whole city where I was thinking like I feel like when. Like like for example, when we were living like near capillaries, like you can just get lost, like exploring. Like just that one area when there's that many like good spots. Like it's sometimes hard to like motivate yourself to go outside. But I feel like in New York that's probably true of literally every place in the city. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. East Village is probably. I want to say the size of Capitol Hill. And it's just one part of men. So it's yeah, Jesus. Yeah, just one part of man had not even got anything else. Oh my god. Yeah. So if you've never in. Sometimes. Yeah. Any standout like I guess like experiences like things you've done so far. Places you visited. Halloween was a lot of fun. I had a couple friends visit and like just the city was so alive. Yeah. And through like a housewarming. It was a great it was a great time. The rooftop bars here are amazing. The views are great. The drinks are expensive. There's so. They're more expensive than Vegas. Like I mean not everywhere. Some places. Only some places. But yeah. Yeah. I did I did go to this. Restaurant slash bar called double chicken, please. And basically they have they have drinks that taste like food. For a. Like do they do they actually taste like I can't even imagine what that would. Yeah. So some of their flavors are like cold pizza, Japanese noodles. Dan key lime pie French toast maple syrup. What else. Does it just. It just tastes like they like liquefied that food. And literally it does it does it. Jesus. Yeah. It doesn't even taste like a drink like it just tastes like the food itself. So it's definitely cool. Yeah. I don't there's no like I don't know if I would go again necessarily because I don't. Yeah, there's no real point to it. But as a novelty, it's cool. You know, wow, this is cool. Yeah. It's like damn it. It didn't realize you could do that. Anyways. They do have a really good fried chicken sandwich. I'd say right you sure still better, but that's say otherwise that double chicken, please, is better. But there's a wrong. Well, you can come and try them for yourself. Yeah. Objective third party. I'm glad you got you. So today we're going to talk about work life. And this is something that I personally have dealt with over the last couple of years struggled with. And it's I feel like a lot of people are age, you know, in their early 20s, like right up for college. Because as they enter the workforce are beginning to struggle with this concept, right? It's like this constant push of pull of work and life. And it's interesting because especially in higher pressure communities, like, and high school and colleges, I feel like it's kind of. We kind of do all this work, right? And push ourselves so hard to get to this point where we're at right now, right? To graduate and get that get that internship, get that job, get that, you know, degree grades, whatever, right? And now we're here. We're in the workforce. We're here. Yeah. Now it's like, okay. We're here. And what are we, are we still doing that? Like are we still are we still trying to get somewhere? Like what's what's the, what's the, what's there's no clear path, right? Yeah. And so it's not like, oh, I just need to do this. And then I'll that'll happen. And then I'm good, right? Because that's kind of the, the mindset, which, which, with which we push ourselves until now. And now suddenly it's like your life could go in so many different directions. And there's no clear path. There's no answers. There's no like, there's no guidance really. And so it's, it's so easy to, you know, get stuck with work life bounds and struggle with it. Because there's no, there's no rulebook. Yeah. What do you think of here? Yeah. I mean, I agree with most of what you said. I think it is slightly different for me because I think for me, like, I feel like I have a strong, I've always had a strong sense of, I guess, like, what I'm passionate about in terms of like, I'm really into philosophy and I'm really into art. And I've always known that like, those are the things I kind of wanted to pursue, like outside of my job. Like, once I started working. But I think for me, it's like, work like, balance is less about like, like, I think for me, like, the biggest way it shows is less than like, I guess, like, now, like, taking a look at my life and like, not knowing what to do as much as it is, like, not taking care of myself and like, not giving myself the time to pursue those passions that I know that I have and those hobbies that I know that I want to pursue. Like, and I think like, the biggest thing for me is that, yeah, like, yeah, it's more about losing that sense of passion because I'm neglecting myself. Yeah. So I guess a good way to start this discussion is probably to talk about, hey, how has, what has work like, balanced meant historically? Like, how has it been historically, right, throughout high school and college? And then, yeah, first couple years into the workforce. So what, what has your experience been so far? It's definitely been rough. Yeah, it's definitely been rough and I don't even know necessarily if that's because, like, like, oh, like, my, my job right now is like that much worse compared to like, yeah, like, I don't know if it's that, like, my job is that much worse compared to like, how things were, like, when I was working for, like, school or anything, like, for I feel like, for me, it's very much that, like, like, growing up, like, like, going through high school and then going through college, like, there's a very set structure. And like, going to college, it's like, yeah, there's like that set structure of like, okay, there's like, there's like, goals I need to achieve, like, I need to get these grades. But like, even, like, it's kind of this weird thing where we had very set, like, goals, but at the same time outside of that, it's like, if we wanted to, like, one day in college, like, we could just like, sleep in the whole day, like, fuck around. And then, like, just like, get our work done, like, when, like, as long as it was before, like, whenever we needed, like, our deadlines were versus, like, I think it's definitely been a shift for me, like, moving into, like, sort of starting my own life and like, having to integrate, like, having that sort of, those sorts of, like, routines and habits about, like, okay, I need to work for this many hours per day. And then, like, I need to, like, schedule and structure my own time. And then, even outside of work, it's definitely, like, I feel like even that's, like, less clear in terms of, like, hobbies and passions because in college, like, obviously, you're living around your friends, like, everyone, like, there's always something to do or, like, you can join in, like, just like, going to their place and, like, hanging out. And then, like, I think, like, I'm just going to be able to, like, just, like, just, like, just, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, just like, like, like, just like, like, like, just like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like like, for me, I feel like, for me, I feel like, I feel like I feel like, I feel like I feel like I, I have struggled with it. For the last couple of weeks, for that for less than 30 years, until the last couple of weeks, for that for about 30 years. It's been obviously there are better times and worse times, but I think it ended up like over the last, not recently, but over the last couple years. It took a big toll on me. It was impacting, it has impacted my life in a lot of negative ways. I felt stuck for a long time. I felt like if you've ever been in an environment where your toll work is life, what do you mean work like balance? Or like, oh yeah, work like balance, but then that will be the official messaging, but then the culture you can't really change that with messaging. It's things that you have to kind of navigate. And as a person who has just entered the workforce, it's difficult to navigate things like that, especially when throughout college things have been very clear. And it's just like, oh yeah, I just need to work this much. You pretty much do what you're told, right? For the most part. And so when you enter the workforce, you kind of have to start making those decisions for yourself, regardless of what anyone or any authority is saying out there. Yeah, I think it definitely took a big toll on me. I think it was always something, right? It was always like, oh, I just need to, I just need to get this project out. I just need to get this promo. It's always, it's always the next promo. Always the next promo. There's always an extra promo. And then I won't care after that. You always tell yourself these things, right? But yeah, it was, it was a lot. It affected me. It affected like my connection to myself. I was just so drained and numb of working that it affected my relationships around me, my relationship, myself. I was not getting time to pursue hobbies to just sit and relax and let my brain wander, right? I think that's something that I missed and that's something that I'm finally getting better at now. Yeah. But I think that's the main thing. Like if you're working so much, it's like you stop feeding your soul, right? Yeah. Does that make your heart full? Make your soul full? Yeah. Yeah. It took, it took a while to even realize that, oh, this is toxic. Yeah. This is giving me anxiety. This is like giving me a lot of stress. And that I don't need to be in that situation. It's a lot of it is to do with your own mindset, right? Regardless of what you're looking at. Like what is, how are you looking at it? Right? Yeah. Yeah. So it's always, I mean, I feel like especially growing up in competitive environment, it's always been like, oh, I need to perform. I need to be better than the others. Like I need to stand out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sacrificing today for tomorrow. Yeah. Right? And that, again, it goes back to the promo, the, you know, the way that I do. If I work, I mean, how many times have you seen this idea, right? Like all these people entering the workforce and then just going like, yeah, my plan is to just work really hard for like five, 10, 15 years and then. Right? Quick, second long detour. Yeah. And just like completely dissociate with yourself for the year. And then life will happen after that, right? Yeah. And that just ends up putting you in this place where you're so lost and yeah, you just kind of stray further and further from yourself. Yeah. You just end up putting off your life until it's all to go over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. That's fucking, that's horrible to hear. Like I can't even imagine that like, yeah, like I feel like there's like so much in what you said just to like all the dynamics of like work like balance, like the mindset, like the external pressure is like I guess like I'm just curious. Do you feel like when you were sacrificing your life, like for work and when you were in that place? Like do you feel like that was more driven by that like external pressure from like your manager and stuff to like, oh, you need to perform better. Oh, you should be working more or do you feel like it was more that like internal like mindset that you talk about where it's like you felt like, okay, I need that next promo. Like I need that next accomplishment. I think it's, I think it's internal, right? I think it's, I mean, external like you can't control the world. People are going to say, right? Like as their own interests, right? Yeah. And your manager has his own interests, you know, business interests and your manager's manager will have the same ones and yeah, it's like corporate world is a hierarchy of what's the word I'm looking for? It's a hierarchy of domination. Yeah, exploitation and exploitation. Yeah. What is right? Definitely some environments. Capital. Definitely, some environments are better at handling it. Yeah. But that's kind of built into the nature of it. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think it was more to do internally. It was this idea of like, hey, I just want to get to this place. Yeah. I don't want to get to this place where I don't have to worry about money. I don't have to worry about, you know, do something else. And especially I think it was combined with the fact that my job, like even though like I was growing and it was like, you know, all these things, but it wasn't, there was something missing for me. I felt like I was sacrificing something for myself, right? Some connection towards what I want to do with my life, severing like a connection towards meaning. Yeah. Yeah. Fundamental level. Yeah. It was extra like, oh, I want to get to this faster. Yeah. That I can go do those things, right? Yeah. So that kind of that kind of mindset. Yeah, as you ask you. Yeah. But I mean, the symptoms of it, man, like let me tell you, like, it was, I was waking, I was going to sleep thinking about work. I was waking up thinking about work, you know, like what I should do, like, yeah, how I can change this. It was, it's like this obsession, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it was just, that's how burnout happens, right? Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was, it was just very consuming. Yeah. To the point where like I would just, I remember like there were times like I would be driving back from work. And I would just be so like, I would be numb in the car to the point where I wouldn't even realize I was driving. I would just drive home and somehow I would like end up at home. Yeah. Like not even thinking about it. And then I would just, I remember like there were so many days I would come back and I would just sit in the car. Yeah. For like, because I was like, I would just be so trained and like I just, I just, I need some time to just sit. And I would prepare in the car, in the garage and just like, breathe. It was not bad. Like it was just, yeah, it was so consuming. Jesus. Yeah. And so if I know, I know for a fact that a lot of people are doing with this orange, yeah, and it is fucking sad. Yeah. It is like truly, truly like I don't wish that on anyone. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not about number of hours necessarily. I know people that are seemingly working more than 60, 70 hours, but they're also fine. Maybe at this point in their life, that's what they need the most. That's what's giving them the passion. Yeah. Not true for everyone. Yeah. Definitely. And that also doesn't have to necessarily do with the number of hours you can, yeah, burn out working 50 hours a week. Yeah. You know, like, yeah. Yeah. I got you. Yeah. It's also, yeah, I, yeah, I can imagine like, like if like, yeah, if the world work is like really difficult, like it doesn't matter if like you only even worked like six or seven hours that day, like you're still going to come back home, like exhausted, like you're not going to have the bandwidth to do anything else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So how? How, like what, what was the point? Like, I guess like when, once you were in that, like, what was your like fracture point? Like, when did you realize like, okay, like this, like I can't do this anymore? Like, was it like a slow like realization? Or was it, was there like one event where you were like suddenly had a clarity? No, it was slow. It was slow. It was, it was a feeling that was slowly marinating inside me. Yeah. And it slowly kept building and building and building. Yeah. And that was actually the first time I started therapy for that specifically for that. How to deal with burnout, like now, like work life balance, that kind of stuff. How to, how to be more in touch with myself. Yeah. Yeah, that's when I started learning some techniques I started practicing, you know, like daily checkings, right? Yeah. And like, oh, every day after work or at any, any, not afterward, or at 3 p.m. or whatever, check in with yourself, right? Hey, what am I feeling? Yeah. Am I feeling stressed? Where am I feeling stressed? Why am I feeling stressed? What I'm going to do about it and what I'm going to do for myself later that day. Yeah. Simple, just literally three simple questions, right? Yeah. I was so surprised that I was, I wasn't asking myself those questions at all. Yeah, yeah, right. And when I did start doing that, by the way, I, I'm terrible at continuing. Like I'm terrible at holding myself to do these things. Yeah. But when I did start doing that, I did it very religiously for like a month or two. Yeah. It helped a lot. Yeah. It helped a lot. It didn't fix everything. It didn't, but it, it, it helped me at least find that voice inside me. Yeah. For the first time, right? It lets you. Yeah. That like, okay, listen, listen to your mind, listen to your body, right? Like, so that, that, that was the first time that, and then, and then kind of everything else built on top of that. Yeah. Yeah. I got you. Yeah, I feel like when you're in that kind of environment, like it's so hard, like part of the reason it's so hard to get out of it is like just, yeah, like you don't even have the time to like, even really acknowledge or like come to terms with like how you're feeling. And like, yeah, it can be difficult to like, like, yeah, it's difficult to find time and I also think like it's so easy to like, like, almost like lie to yourself and be like, oh, I'm fine. Like, like, to not, to, to almost like think like, oh, like I, I know how I'm feeling. Like, I don't, like, yeah, you don't need to, you don't necessarily need to take that step back even though like, once you do, like even if it's only for a couple of minutes, like, yeah, like you've suddenly realized like, oh, there's been so much stuff like I wasn't like letting myself like be aware of or like I didn't have the bandwidth to like, yeah, like have awareness of, yeah. So the way I think about it is kind of like being an operating in first person. Yeah. Like in a shooting game, like, yeah, yeah. Like, there's you have a first person view and then you have a third person. Yeah. Yeah. 30 person. One point five person view where it's slightly outside your normal view of the vision. And then you suddenly you can see more clearly where you're actually at. Yeah. It's so much easier to orient yourself. Yeah. I should have known. I should have known. I said, yeah, I think that first person should have. Like, life is an FBS, bro. Yeah. Obviously, though, like that's such like a, that's such like a perfect metaphor because I think it very much is like taking that step back to like be aware of yourself. Like you get so caught up like just in like what you're doing, like that immediate, like a perspective or like tasks that you're working on that like you don't take that step back to be like, where the fuck am I? Like what is my life right now? Yeah. Yeah. How has it been for you? Like what do we have the, what have the, um, the downturns been like in times where you like say weeks where you have terrible work by thoughts right? You're working constantly throughout the week. Yeah. What do you have? Um, I mean like just like my fucking like mental health, just like plummet, like I'm like I find myself like really stressed out by everything like irritable, like I definitely like I think a big thing is like just like all of like my passion and like the enjoyment I get out of like like everyday activities just like gets sucked out of me like there's lots of times like like I don't like like what yeah when my work like balance is bad like it's like I'll give myself time like to like I'll try to give myself time to like take a break and like like focus on my life and it's just like I won't even really know where to start or what to do just because like I feel so drained that it's like I don't really want to do anything like nothing really gives me that like joy anymore like I think like that's one of the big things for me and um I think that's very related to again like like my mental health like because I think uh yeah like that's a big part of like when my mental health gets worse like I just lose that enjoyment and then I stop like really like taking care of myself as much like I stop like eating well sleeping well things like that and it's sort of like this loop where it's like um like maybe like I have like a rough week because of like personal things or because of something at work and then it's like because of that like I'm uh I take care of myself less and then I because of that like it becomes harder to keep up with work and I start like yeah like just dealing with work in like a more unhelpful way and like that causes me to take care of myself even less and so yeah yeah it's like this like self perpetuating cycle almost until like I finally like forced myself to like take a step back and I'm just like okay like I can't I can't live like this or like my therapist like I'll like a lot of times like when I go to therapy like I feel like the big thing is just that like like you were saying like that just gives some time to like take a step back and just be like okay like you don't like you don't need to be working this hard on this or like like like like getting this project out by the end of the week like isn't as important as you actually think like you have a lot more time to take care of yourself and yeah yeah I'd say like that's like that's pretty much like the cycle for me like one fight where flight balance goes out of whack yeah that makes yeah yeah it's like every day like other tasks overwhelm you right it's like yeah it's like and then everything else also kind of feels just like a task you know yeah yeah okay cleaning yeah talking to people yeah yeah you know calling home like yeah you know you know whoever it is you need to call yeah yeah if you know relationship that like it's just everything just so like just because you don't know you're not in touch with yourself at all yeah everything else is so so bad any oh definitely yeah every every single thing just feeding yourself yeah yeah yeah when that like yeah because like when that enjoyment goes away it's like they aren't like things you enjoy anymore right they stop becoming a part of your life and they just become like okay like I have to eat every day so it's like I'm ticking off that box it's like just like yeah yeah and I think one thing I've noticed just over the last couple years is this like you were saying there's a cycle but I'd say like I'd say there's also a cycle for like staying um right because you're so tired and you're so burned out from everything it's like do you have you ever noticed like a lot of older people like parents yeah for jobs and stuff who just after work all they do is like stare at the TV yeah yeah that's definitely that's that thing right like yeah I feel like there's a whole generation of people that are just glued to the TV yeah and there's a reason for that right like it's not out of nowhere it's because you're so burnt out and sucked out of everything yeah right from your job and not just job like everything for this this society has set up for us you know I mean the job is more thing but the reason you do this job is because you have to fucking pay for healthcare and you have to pay for you know this three million dollar house in the Bay area and you have to pay for your kids college tuition right and you have to leave you have to send money back home like all of these things right and so that's the reason you do it yeah but then you're not in touch with yourself at all yeah you don't know you lose purpose for your very own being of existence right yeah not in not in relation to other people like yeah I have to live for these other people but like why do you have to live for yourself you kind of lose that right and so then you can't create yeah in your free time you can't create anything you can't you can't create any art you can't work on anything cool yeah just consume and so yeah that's the sum of TV and like for that generation it's TV yeah if you just find yourself watching Netflix all the time like yeah yeah it's like that right and for us I feel like it's manifested itself and staying glued to our phones and oh yeah I'm pretty talk and social media like any kind of social media it's just passive entertainment it's not entertainment it's just like it's it's a way to keep our minds in yeah actually creating being creative yeah white noise yeah it's just white noise and it's just it's not even relaxing yeah anyone says watching tiktoks is relaxing it's it's not your foolish head like it's it's literally like you you will never feel more well rested after watching tiktoks for an hour you know what I mean most of the time yeah I think I think I think I already trained which is yeah yeah yeah it's just pure entertainment I understand but it is 95% never that yeah right it's not used in that way yeah yeah you know when I found out it was a problem it was when is when I realized I was ignoring people people that I like there would be there would be messages on my phone from people Right. People who I love, people who like, you know, I have these connections with and I would ignore them. And instead spend time on reels or TikTok, you know, and that's when I realized that this is, and I started questioning why that is, like, why is it that I do that? Yeah. And I realized that that was a reason I just didn't have the energy to engage with them. Yeah, yeah. And then that was, that was like, and that's when I realized I had a problem. Yeah, yeah. Because the reels, they give you so much in return. Right. They give you so much, they give you a much higher dopamine kick. For putting in nothing. Yeah. So then it's like, then obviously your brain is going to prefer that. It's going to be a fact because we don't even know how to we don't even know how to react to these kind of stimulus. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. The whole science of social media is really, really interesting. Yeah. Our brains are not built to handle this shit. And it's like, it's very much built to exploit us. Yeah. She's dystopian. Yeah. Yeah, not even like, yeah, there's like the social media, like, our brain's not being able to handle it. There's the algorithms. Like there's so many ways, like, talk stuff and explain it. Yeah. If you're listening to this, like, I want you to ask yourself, when was the last time you actually felt well rested? And if you have an answer to that question, I'm already jealous of it. And like, we're doing something right. And please, please share your experience. And like, but as far as I can tell, like, most people are struggling with this. Yeah, this like, and you said, well, you rested, I started yawning. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, definitely. Yeah, it's a problem. It's sort of like, uh, almost like, I don't know, like it, it almost seems like, like, I wonder like, like, I feel like it's like, like, I definitely agree with what you're saying about, like, social media and like, the way that we sort of get, like, lulled into, like, disability and so now, like, actually thinking about, like, okay, like, why am I doing this? Like, why don't, like, like, why don't I have the energy to do other things I want to do with my life? But I almost see it as, like, do you, like, I kind of see it as like a symptom of, like, the problem, you know, because I feel like when I do have that energy, like, when I am, like, taking care of myself, like, it's almost like the, the motivation to, like, do that. Like, is a lot lower too, right? Like, it's like, I feel like more motivated to, like, go out and like spend time with my friends and like, just explore and stuff. So, I wonder like, like, like, I guess like, from your perspective, like, do you feel like, like, do you see it as more of like a symptom or like, do you feel like that's like, contributed to the problem for you before? Like, I mean, like, it's, I guess for me, like, it's definitely contributed in the sense where it's like, like, just took up my attention, like, white noise and like, so I didn't, like, take that step back. And I wasn't like, being mindful about like what I was doing. But yeah, just curious. Yeah, no, I think I don't think it's just a symptom. I think it contributes to the problem because it takes something out of you, right? Like, when you get those, like, when you get those, like, it's different when you're like, looking for entertainment, right? But when you're scrolling in your past time, when, like, you know, when you're already down and tired, right? It's making your brain more tired. There is something that is lost. There's something that is lost by doing that. It's the ability to create or apply something that you know already. Yeah, let's say you spent all this time learning, right? You have certain ideas and ideas of philosophy. And instead of learning more, there's a certain sense of like, just sitting with what you do have, right? And allowing your brain to wander with it. Yeah. And create. It's taking away from that constant, never-ending bombardment of information is taking away from that ability to create. Because the most creative mind is a board mind, right? Like, that's what research tells us. Like, you know, yeah, like in the, like, not actively doing something, or like, not actively engaged. Yeah. Like allowing your brain to engage itself instead of being engaged by an external stimulus. Yeah. Like, I don't see like, I guess, like social media has anything like inherently negative, you know? It's like, yeah, sure. It's like, not something that's like, I think, like, in good way, I think about it, it's like, like, in the past, there have always been like, like, back in fucking like Socrates Day, like, like, philosophers would talk about like, oh, kids these days are just like, like, playing games with their wooden toys instead of reading books. Like, they're not like, they should be like, actively, like, studying and like, trying to understand these things. But instead, they're just like, wasting these time with these like, like, frivolous, like, activities. Like, I don't really see, like, any big difference between like, like, that and like, social media in a certain sense. Like, I think that, like, we've always found ways to like, I guess, like, waste time. And like, we've always like, like, like, felt like they're all like, they're always been these concerns about like, oh, like, is this causing like the kids to get stupider or is this like, like, yeah, like, just like that, like, if those things weren't there, like, oh, like, maybe like, people would be better off, and like, they would be spending their time, like, doing more, like, like, engaging, like, more actively with things which are more valuable to them. But I don't, like, I don't really see a big difference between social media and like, distractions in the past that people have worried about, you know, like, I think like, social media, like, I was saying, like, is definitely like more, like, negative in the sense where it's like, more exploitative of our brains, like, pleasure centers. Like, it's definitely like, like, they're obviously like, better or worse distractions. But I don't see anything like inherently negative or like, not much more negative than like, distractions in the past, you know? I'm not saying that social media is inherently evil. It's always the relationship with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And so I'm saying that a lot of people have that relationship with social media. I know for a fact that I would have been, I would be better off if I didn't a lot on these things. And I think I'm redefining my relationship with these things. And it has helped me a lot. Yeah. Because I do find myself having the energy too. Yeah, yeah. Who's something simple, like, respond to people, right? Like, which is so like dumb if you think about why the hell am I not responding to people? But I'm going and scrolling on these apps. Yeah. But yeah. So now I'm able to do that for. Yeah. I mean, I think that's perfectly fair. Like, I think a lot of people have like an unhealthy relationship with social media. I guess like, yeah, like the point I was more trying to get it is like, yeah, I don't think there's anything like like like, like again, like, there's nothing like inherently negative, right? It's like just the relationship that you have like being mindful about that relationship. Yeah. No, I think it's about understanding your relationship you have with these things. Yeah. Because once you do that, you will know whether it is a problem or not. Yeah. In my case, I examined the relationship I had with social media. And I found that it was a problem. And so I've been working on redefining. Yeah. And I encourage everyone to do the same thing because I think a lot of people would benefit from yeah, analysis. Yeah. Yeah. No arguments there. Yeah. I guess like, it's almost for me. Like, I feel like, like, I guess like now, like thinking about it, like, I have a better sense of like why I was bringing this up more, which is that like, I feel like for me sometimes like that idea of like, oh, like, I'm just like, like mindlessly browsing on my phone. Like, I should be doing like, like more active things. Like, I think that can almost like turn into like toxic, like mindset again, where I start thinking about like, oh, like, I need to be using all my time productively. Like, I shouldn't be doing anything passive. I shouldn't be like, like, resting there. So I guess that's more like a me thing. But yeah, I think you're definitely right. That's not the message at all. Yeah. It's not like, oh, go out there and be more productive. Yeah. Just allow your brain, the, you know, the time to yeah, be. Yeah. And things will naturally come. And for a long time, maybe even they won't come. Yeah. Right. You will have a low, like the first time you're off the phone, it's not like, you're just going to be magically fucking in like this post-nut claim and everything's going to be clear, right? It's going to, you're just going to be existing for some time. Yeah. And things will naturally come like slowly. You'll have a thought. Yeah. That's interesting. I don't want to learn more about that. Definitely. Yeah. You know, engage with this. I want to make this dish. I want to go. Yeah. I don't know anything. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever it is, man, like I feel like I don't have this some form of meaning inside of it. And I think that's what I'm, that's what I'm trying to say. Everyone has like some artistic value. Yeah. Like some artistic drive inside that. Yeah. Right. But I think where that social media has been toxic for a lot of people and for me is it's preventing that from coming out. Yeah. Because you're toxic. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So like whatever it is, like dancing, music, like, yeah. Yeah. If it's engineering, it's engineering. That's great. Like, you know, philosophy, yeah. Photography, cooking, podcasting, yeah. Writing, create. I want to literally anything. Encourage people to do something. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have these things about, oh, like, it won't be perfect. Why even try. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, if it's not better than everyone else. Yeah. But that's not the point of art, right? Yeah. Almost turned art into this competition. Yeah. Which is so dumb. Yeah. I am. Yeah. Go ahead. No, I was going to be like, oh, other people draw better than me. Why even draw? Yeah. I got you. I got you. And then you know, like, I want to help break that in some way. Yeah. Like, I want to, um, let's maybe we should start a column or something. Maybe we should start institutions. It's like, we'll use our platform to showcase. Wait. That would, I would be kind of down because I actually watch a podcast where like every episode, like, people submit, like, just fan art of the people in the podcast and like, they show that before each episode. No, totally. That's yeah. Like any art send us your best pineapple drawings. No, but I'm not even saying that. I'm not even related to the podcast. Just any piece of art. Oh, yeah. I got you know, yeah. Yeah. Show it. Just anything. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little clay pot you made, like, whatever. Like, be proud of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, definitely. I think that's very fair. Like, I think like the key is like just like, almost like, it's like to take like an active role in like, what you're doing and like, what you're doing, like, in your life. Since we were talking about like, taking those steps like to do, like, to do things more actively and to like engage with your life more, like, what, what do you think, like, the big things that you've, or like the big steps you've taken so far that have been positive. Like, what have you seen, like, that you really enjoy and that you really like doing now that you've taken that step back. I think in the process of figuring out how to navigate this kind of constant push and pull of work like that, it's, that comes later. I still, I'm still even getting to that part where I'm focusing out what things I actually enjoyed doing. Yeah. I think a lot of it has been understanding, trying to figure out why, how I ended up in this place in the first place. Yeah, you guys. Because until you do that, I feel like, so here's what happened, right, for me. I was like, okay, I'm going to invest more in my hobbies. Okay. Instead of working all, working all the time, right? Yeah. At, you know, at my job. Yeah. And so I was like, all right, let me do that. So I tried achieving work life balance by working on my hobbies and myself more, but I'm still operating within the same lens that I've always operated it. Yeah. So everything became a job. Yeah. So if I picked up music production, or if I picked up playing the guitar, we're going to the gym, whatever, it became an obsession to it became I have to do this every day. I have to make this much progress in this much time. I have, this is the future that I see with it, you know, this long-term vision, this plan, it just all came up naturally with it. And so after like a little bit of doing that, I would burn out and it would overwhelm me, and I wouldn't even realize that it's doing that, but I would not want to do those things. Yeah. Right. So then like, it was like, okay, like what is going on really? Yeah. Right. And I think a lot of, after a lot of reflections, like, I think I think it's too front, right? One is like, one is like, there's there are practices to, to help figure out what you want to do where you're at now. And there's some ways to do that. And the second part is the roots. So first, I'll talk about that root, right? Yeah. And that's for me, that has been like this kind of, in high school, I developed this work ethic because things were difficult. Like, it wasn't like, I wanted to stand out, but I wasn't like, I wasn't the class genius, you know what I mean? Like, I wasn't like, oh, just retaining information at light speed. Yeah. Yeah. Like understanding things the first time, no, it was a lot of, it was a lot of hard work, right? And so I developed that work ethic and kind of that obsession. And then I allowed that to consume my life. But now, when I do anything, I do it with that same lens. Yeah. Yeah. So everything just becomes, while it helped me in that moment, that skill that it helped me in that moment, you know, get to college, graduate college, like all these things, right? Yeah. Now, at this point in my life, it's taking away from my experience, right? Like, now I'm realizing that that's not all there is to it. This is kind of a segue into this book that I read called Porter Life. Okay. And it's a really great book. I think it came out maybe a couple of years ago. It's kind of describes how people are on a range between stability type and meaning type. And stability types generally, like, the idea is like, though, oh, you view the world as like kind of a series of obstacles that you have to overcome and things you have to achieve, you know, setting things up for a better tomorrow. Yeah. It's kind of like the way we describe conventional success in our society, right? And like, how you're supposed to live your life, what it means to, you know, being a homeowner by 30, like getting married, like, you know, all these things, right? Yeah. Retiring at 60, like, everything. Yeah. And then you have, and then on the other end of the spectrum is meaning types, where it's like, generally, people who fall into the far end of this bucket is like, you know, people who usually don't conform to these norms where for these people, like, the world kind of looks grim and pointless and depressing. And, you know, these structures that are there just kind of feel wrong and daunting. And they're kind of branded as non-conformist. It's not that they don't have aptitude or talent. They have a lot of that, but they struggle with like, you know, everyday things, right? And I'm engaging with everyday things, like, you know, setting up before 1K, thinking about finance, like, thinking about like, whatever the fuck, right? Well, you gotta add me like this, bro. All of those, let me write those down. Am I describing you? You're using the text? You literally mean. Yeah. But yeah, continue, continue. No, I think there are, while there may be some inherent nature to these things, for me, I'm realizing like, I would, like, if you'd asked me a couple of years ago, I would have probably been like, yeah, I'm a stability type. Yeah. But I don't think that's true. I don't think someone is a stability type or someone is a meeting type. Yeah. Yeah. I think someone has a, like, everyone has a certain percentage of this, like, and this will change over time, right? But I think, I think for me, what I learned was, I learned how to be a stability type by developing kind of, by like going into hyperdrive and like, yeah. And like figuring out how to be conventional in that, yeah. How to be successful in the conventional sense of the world. Yeah. Like, and but what I realized is that was taking away from me feeling fulfilled, if it wasn't helping me feel fulfilled. Yeah. And that's a kind of the point of the book where it's like, okay, like if you grew in up one way, if you look at life through this way, like you're probably need, like you'll hit a point where like, you'll want to find more meaning. Yeah. You want to like, let go of these things and, and kind of going, there is a certain act of balancing that happens. Yeah. Yeah. For meaning, for people who start out, like on the meaning path, like they're more like, for them, it's more like learning how to engage with the world in a way that doesn't overwhelm them. Yeah. And like also helps them, like, you know, be successful in that conventional sense. But keep feeding their soul. And I think that's what it is for both these people. It's like, it's like similar to like having both masculine and feminine energy. Yeah. Yeah. If life is a mixture of these things, right? And you need both, everything, regardless of what gender you are, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well balanced. Exactly. Yeah. And so and so that's, that's what I realized. And yeah, I was at a point where it's like, oh yeah, everything needs to be optimal. My fucking credit cards have to be optimal. I need the best vacation. I want to go to the gym. I want to work out myself. Like I want all of these things. But it's like, it was so overwhelming. And like, yeah. And at the end, I still felt empty, you know, like, yeah, it's like, it's like, I was almost doing these ways as a way to doing these things as a way to deflect from them. Dinos as feeling inside. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get that. Oh, something is wrong. And so it's interesting. Like I'll tell people now, like, when when people are like, no, when you were you up to like, how's life? Like, you know, I tell people, I'm learning how to be responsible. I'm learning how to just listen to myself. And I'm learning how to let go of like, all these conventional ideas. Yeah. I'm learning how to leave my room messy. Yeah. You know, not cook, because I don't want to. Yeah. That was the problem always. Whenever I had some free time, I spent it figuring out how to make my life easier in the future. Yeah. So if I had free time, I would go do my laundry. Yeah. Off to my house. Yeah. I would go like, I would go meal prep something for tomorrow. Or I'd go book a flight for later. That, you know, so that is done in advance. And I get a good price and like, all this shit, right? And it was just constantly, constantly that instead of actually relaxing or actually like, yeah, honestly, actually relaxing, even giving me the chance to approach something that's more meaningful. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That was, yeah. So that's that's kind of my kind of roots, I guess, on the issue. The second part, what I was mentioning is the things that are helping me kind of achieve that, helping me trying to get in touch with myself a little bit more. Yeah. First of all, the daily check-ins, like I mentioned, right? Like, what am I feeling? Where am I feeling it? What am I going to do the rest of the day? I was listening to this podcast and it had this Buddhist teacher, Jack Cornfield, on it. And he'd be like, when you're feeling these things, when you're feeling confused, like overwhelmed, like, anything, just ask yourself, hey, what would love have me do today? And if you're feeling overwhelmed, maybe the answer is stay in order food, right? Yeah. Take care of yourself. I feel like that's what work like balance comes down to. It's just listening to yourself. Yeah. Like, oh, if I separating like, oh, how you treat yourself versus like, is imagine you were your best friend. Yeah. A separate person. What would you tell your best friend to do if they listed out everything going on in their head and their life? Right. And just like asking that question. Yeah. And then the answer becomes more clear. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah. I don't know, man. I feel like, if I went back and I told that person, like if I told myself, like a year, two years ago, like, hey, at the, at the end of every single day, you deserve to feel whole and full and not worry about all the things you have to do tomorrow and just mean that life happened. I would have looked at myself funny. I would have been like, you, that's the weirdest fucking shit I've ever heard. No, I got you. Like, if I did that, like, how am I going to have a multimeter? Yeah. And be able to take exotic vacations. Yeah. And to fucking Saint Lucia and St. Shells and Santorini and not have to work after that. Yeah. I like. Yeah. But yeah. No, I got you. Yeah. I mean, like, I, I, yeah. No, I mean, I feel, I feel exactly the same way. Like, I definitely, like, not like, I think like what you said about like, like, treating yourself like your best friend, like giving yourself that compassion. Like, I definitely, like, feel like for me too. Like, that's something that's very foreign for me. And like, just like instinctively my reaction, like, especially in the past, like now to a certain extent too. Like, I, I think like that idea of like, treating myself well and like giving myself time, like, I would have, like, just been like, no, like, yeah, like that would have seen, like, such an alien, like, stupid idea to me. Yeah. Yeah. I think one kind of perspective that helps me is that this kind of doing a bunch of stuff every day and being productive. And this kind of conventional six idea of success is only there because because that's the society week built. Yeah. Yeah. Where that is valued over everything else. Yeah. And once you kind of realize that it's like, what the hell am I doing? What? Yeah. Yeah. No, I got this concept like blows my mind some time. Yeah. Just take a step back and be like, what the fuck is this actually? Yeah. Yeah. But I do want to say, like, I feel like it's a privilege that we've been talking about this. Oh, definitely. Yeah. That we even have the luxury to talk about this. Yeah. A lot of people don't. Because a lot of people don't. Yeah. Like they're just doing this to survive. Yeah. Like if you're burnt out and you have all these things to do, like, all these bills to pay and, you know, kids to send to college and medical stuff to worry about, like everything, like, that sentence won't make sense to you. Yeah. Like, hey, what would love have me do today? You'd probably just goff at it. Like, what do you mean? Love would have me pay the bills today. Yeah. Of work to send my kids to college. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. But I think these conversations are still important because that's what's going to help the move the needle forward. Right? Definitely. I mean, like, we're definitely privileged to have like the ability to like have this conversation, but like, it's like that, that should be a privilege that everyone has, right? Like, yes. Everyone should have the ability to do what's fulfilling to them. Not like nobody should have to be in that mode where like all you're doing is surviving, right? All you're doing is just like ticking off things one day to the next, hoping that like your kids will have like a better life, like a life where they don't have to do that, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what is it? Is it Mazzlobs hierarchy? Yeah. That's what that's about. Self-actualization. Yeah. We just have to get to the next level. Yeah. Yeah. It's so interesting because I think like a lot of like this mindset, like, that causes us to like sacrifice our work-life balance, like, comes from those sorts of situations that we're talking about, right? Like, for my parents, like, like, for my dad, for example, like, he grew up, like, he had to support like, like, four or five siblings, like, off of his income, he had to support like his parents, like, to a certain extent, like, that was a luxury he didn't have, and I think like, almost like, that just almost like, without thinking gets passed on to the next generation, even though like, that's not necessary for us anymore. Or like, that's not, yeah. So it's like, but at the same time, like, we still end up inheriting that mindset. We still like, just end up, like, assuming like, okay, like, this is what we have to do. When in reality, it's like, our parents made it for us, like, we should be enjoying the life that they've given us, and also for them, like, like you were saying, like, they don't need to be in that mode anymore, either, right? Like, they can also spend the time, like, they've made it now, like, they can see, okay, now what do I actually care about, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then I feel like it's our responsibility to keep going forward. Yeah. Especially for future generations. Yeah. So, and just society in general, right, keep advocating for that. Yeah. Definitely. I think it's so like, yeah, good. Oh, no, it's going to say, I think there's a quote by like, Benjamin Franklin, who said that like, my parents studied, like, or like, I studied a war, so that my children could study science and mathematics, and they study science and mathematics, so their children can spend their life like studying art and philosophy. So they can reach a point where like, they can just pursue like, like, to create, to like pursue that fulfilling life. And we have to keep like, moving forward and like, like, pushing for that instead of like being stuck in the past, stuck in like, those old mindsets. This is the idea we kind of kind of boost sense of that. It's so like, it's so interesting. I saw this post once about how every every decade since the 1850, there's been a newspaper article that says with the same headline that says, oh, some version of, oh, the new generation, oh yeah, the new generation wants everything easy. Yeah. You don't want to work because they don't want to put in the effort like we, like they just want everything given to them. Yeah. And it's so telling that you have the same idea that has down yeah, every generation. Yeah. Every generation is like, fucking kids these days have it too. When it's like, to a certain extent, like, that's like, like, that's the proof that they made it, right? Like, that's what they wanted initially. Yeah, literally. Like, I hope my kids have it easier than me. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, but no, that's a thing, right? It's me. But also like, understanding their perspective, it's like, they're so bitter from all the shit that you, right? Because it was so fucking terrible for them. No, definitely. Yeah. They're like, oh, like, why is it so much easier for this guy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. And it's also like a lack of understanding, right? It's like, if you're used to such a harder life, like the things which we might struggle with might seem so trivial. Like, like, why are you, why are you spending so much mental energy on that? Like, why are you like, like, like, why are, why are you taking these things so hard when it's just, yeah, like that, like, the same way that, like, it's like the same way that other people being happier than us doesn't invalidate our happiness, it's like the fact that other people have it harder than us doesn't invalidate our difficulties, right? And the point is, is to hopefully, yeah, like, we were saying, like, get to a point where, the vast majority of people or nobody has to like, struggle the way that like, our parents and our grandparents had to, right? The good thing is, I think, we are ahead of it in the right direction. The fact that you and I are sitting here and having this conversation, definitely, is a sign of progress. 100 percent, yeah. And I do think companies in corporate world, like, we're, they're being more and more cognizant about these things. And even though some of these things are performative, yeah, like, there's no question about it. We're still in a better place than we were. Oh, 100 percent, yeah. 20 years ago. And that's how, like, it'll keep making progress. Yeah, right? Definitely, yeah. The fact that, like, mental health, this mental health, like, therapy is so much more accessible. Yeah, more normalized. And there's more normalized people. The point is to really understand where you're at. And why you are there. Yeah, what you can do to make it better. That's it. That's all therapy is really, right? Yeah. It's not more complicated than that. Yeah. And so just that having that be more accessible, I think pushing us that direction. So many things offering free therapy for their employees, which is, yeah, yeah. No, I definitely think like, yeah, it's a big improvement. Like, it's almost like a sign of like what we were saying of things like improving, right? It's like once we, once we start moving into direction where we, our physical needs are taken care of, like, now it's like, okay, like, what, like, what do we need? Where do we need to be mentally to actually both be fulfilled? Where do we need to be? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I kind of, I guess like, I guess the question you originally asked, right? Yeah. What has the process been like for getting more in touch with yourself and like figuring out what what things give me more? Yeah. And stuff like that. Yeah. You know, I started going to yoga. Yeah. Yeah. Yoga. Yeah. Yoga has been cool. I've been taking random classes around the city. He's just like trying to figure out like I took a Pilates class. Yeah. Very cool. It was very, very hard. Yeah. I was about to say I was trembling. Oh my god. Like it was so hard. It's not easy. Also, yoga is hard. Like if you go, if you're going to a good proper yoga, yeah, proper yoga. I have been like every time I've gone to yoga so far. Like so far. Yeah. I've I've sweated. Yeah. And I've also felt so much more relaxed. Yeah. Yeah. And just like open. And I think it's interesting. I have realized things as I'm doing the yoga. Like releasing things that are stored. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, you know, places in my body and um, Oh, definitely. Yeah. No, I got you. I mean, I think fundamentally that's what it is, right? Like it's that process of like taking care of yourself and like being attuned to your own needs. Like the specifics of like what you end up doing or what you're passionate about. Like that obviously very from like what time in your life it is like who you are. But like the fundamental like process is what's important. Like, yes. And there's a certain sense of you need to explore. You need to go and see what you're in and leave it for yourself. Yeah. Right. And then you and then like over time, you'll know. Yeah. Yeah. No, 100%. Yeah. I feel like assuming in advance, like what those things are is almost like the fundamental problem, right? We like, because I think like, yeah, like when you don't take that step back and like take that time to listen to yourself, like a lot of times you fall into those unhealthy habits just like on impulse and you just assume, like, okay, like these are the things I want to do in my life. Like you were saying, right? Like, oh, I want to accomplish these things. When in reality, like it's about giving you that space, giving yourself that space to like explore. Yeah. I guess I had like some like a story kind of or like related to like when you were talking about like the stability, like my like a personality type and like how like the sorts of realizations you came across, like I almost feel like as someone who like leans more towards like the meaning type, like it's so fascinating to see like I feel like the issues that I struggled with were so different, but like fundamentally like the underlying issues were so similar about like like I was saying like not taking that time to listen to myself, not like forgiving myself. Like I think like throughout like my life, like I've very much struggled with like, okay, like I know like like even back in like like elementary school and middle school, like I knew like I was really passionate about philosophy, but it's like I've always struggled with like feeling, I guess like it's like when you when you talk about like those norms about like certain things you're supposed to accomplish, like I have like very much felt like this sense of like, oh, why should I be doing these things? Like that's not actually what I want to do with my life, this like instinctive like I guess like like attempt to escape from like those things, like I guess like the norms that I felt like society was trying to put on me, and I feel like that almost itself became something that I started doing like mindlessly and started becoming like destructive. Yeah, like there didn't really been projects where like I was working on design or a big milestone for my promotion where because there were certain deadlines I need to hit like I ended up working on hours or like like ruining my sleep and then or I might like or I might decide like, oh, like I'm not going to go out like this weekend, I'm just going to like stay in the apartment and like just like grind it out like just like the the entire like weekend or I would end up like neglecting going to the gym because I was like, oh, I need that extra time to like finish up like yeah, like the projects I'm working on and what would end up happening is that like I would start like I would just end up like skipping those things more and more to the point where like it wasn't even really that I was getting much work done, it was just essentially that like like yeah, like I like just like that like feeling that like oh I need to like spend longer on this like I need to make sure it's perfect like I need to make sure like it's done at a certain time like I just ended up like consuming my life like with work to a point where it wasn't even that I was working effectively anymore it was just that like I was constantly consumed with like that worry and that stress and like that feeling that like oh I need to be like working more and I need to be like like yeah being more productive and so I would end up like neglecting myself and like yeah nothing caring myself and like yeah just ending up in a really bad place mentally where sometimes I would like have to take like a sick day just because like I felt like I ended up feeling so awful and it's like I would realize after that like oh like you took the whole day off like nothing actually happened no one really cared that much like it wasn't like there was actually this like world ending deadline that you need to get done but it's just like I got so like consumed that mindset that I would just like mindlessly like throw myself at it like even though like it wasn't actually like like even from the standards of like oh like I have to like work well and I have to work like optimally like I wasn't even doing that I was just like burning myself like down to the down to ashes I think there's a certain sense of being made to feel more important than you are right like it like I feel like that's a common thing and so you feel like you have to work a lot and yeah you're like oh I'm the only one who can do this I have to do this yeah this this project is my baby you know I look at all of these feelings right and it's like burn yourself out yeah you know the the plans of the future and all that right um the other thing there is because we're so burnt out from the week and so repressed we have this big release on the weekend right like big release where all we get together you know if you just go out drinking and and um yeah yeah drinking and getting high and they're like all of these things right yeah um and this where like the work hard play hard yeah comes but it's so like that's such a flawed ideology because life happens between the work hard and play hard yeah it's like it's like it's like it's like we built up all this frustration and we have this be at least right and then we're back to the same frustration again yeah uh and we're not any well more well rested we're not full it's like taking vacation they feel like my there was a point in time my mom would be like oh like what do you mean you're burnt out like you're taking all these vacation and it's like they don't help like yeah don't help like it yeah they're like a temporary escape and it's like the same shit yeah it doesn't actually help you feel any better yeah um or any more yeah prepared to go back yeah I mean I know I do living for the weekends and for the vacations it kind of gets built into our heads yeah and a lot of times like yeah like you were saying like it's not like it's not even that it's a big release it's just afterwards like you you still feel a shitty a lot of times like if you drink and stuff like you end up feeling even shittier but it's just like like yeah you're not you're not releasing any of that stress you're not releasing any of that unhappiness you're just burning your free time yeah no I think this is this is what I was trying to say with the whole social media yeah yeah it's like this is what's preventing us right yeah like this is what's preventing us from yeah engaging with ourselves yeah and with the world it's like yeah as soon as we have this time now we're fucking we're like all right I just need to I just need a big release like I'm so tired from work let's all get together let's party let's yeah just get high like I don't know whatever yeah yeah yeah in other like you know there's new like I know like things like investment banking they have a big coke culture yeah I think it all comes back to the same thing yeah I mean that's almost like like yeah like that's it just like that what we're talking about like just even worse like it's like that that has like rotted even more where it's like when you're in that kind of high stress environment it's like you end up like going for more destructive ways of like releasing that energy releasing that pent up like unhappiness right it's honestly it's a way of keeping your feelings repressed yeah yeah right like that's all it is like you watch you you what I mean you've all seen wolf of Wall Street the reason they're like oh you know the whole rookie numbers yeah what does it do it just rip it just number it goes up yeah that's literally it all it is it's just like okay like it's an unhealthy coping mechanism yeah this is what we talked about last time right yeah it's like the coat and the yeah jacking up for yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah keeping yourself under control yeah yeah yeah it's not about like this or that distraction it's just like mindlessly burning your time instead of like taking that like time to actually live your like and live for yourself so that you don't have to deal with those feelings at all yeah exactly yeah it's like yeah you're not you're not actually resolving those feelings you're distracting yourself yeah I mean I've definitely fallen into that like mindset before where it's like yeah like after I have like such a shitty week it's like I'm like okay like I'm gonna go party today I'm gonna like drink like just let out all my stress and it's just like I don't the next day I don't feel any happier I don't like some a lot of times like I'm not even like like even when I'm growing like I can still feel some of that life just like builds up tension like it's not like I'm as happy as I would be like if I spent that time to like calm down and relax and like like spend time for myself yeah but I'm glad that we're realizing yeah yeah right and seeing it for what it is yeah that we can at least yeah start the process to try to change it yeah definitely I mean we're never gonna be perfect right no ones ever gonna be perfect the point is like to acknowledge what you're doing and to try and like take some like agency there yeah all right so to summarize like I'm realizing work life balance comes down to answering these questions about yourself really it's one is like are you in touch with yourself are you able to feed different parts of your soul are you satisfied with your life like and do you feel whole at the end of the day and what I feel like is you can you can kind of listen to anyone's feel about work life balance like no matter who it is you know Warren Buffett Jeff Bezos or any like big hot shot CEO and you know whatever they have to say about these things but I think what it comes down to is that work life balance is about you the life and work life balance is your life you know it's like you're the one living this life and you know kind of there's no like blueprint really that you can follow to achieve the perfect work life balance I think you it's just a process of staying in touch with yourself as much as possible and if you're able to do that and you're able to you know work a lot and work a lot and whatever you are working in and that's great but it may not be true so it doesn't really matter what anyone else is saying I feel like it's just are you satisfied with your life yeah and where you're at right now that's all yeah definitely just being mindful of yourself and whether you actually want to do what you're doing or whether yeah whether it's actually fulfilling you or not and it's almost like that when we were when we were talking about like the connections between work like balance and anxiety like I almost feel like like it's similar for anxiety right it's not like there's like oh like you believe like these specific things to get over your anxiety or you have to do like X or Y like specific activities right it's more about being mindful of yourself and how you're feeling and continuing to like yeah yeah yeah just staying mindful I guess yeah I mean that's all there is so again like as we're wrapping this up thank you guys for you know listening in I'd like to plug our Instagram

podcast can reach more people we we're always asking questions engaging like trying to get your guys' thoughts on these topics too before we record the episode so we'd love to have you guys engage there so for the for the for the for the art pick of the episode what do you have here I feel like it's kind of off I don't know how to put it like off or off base for what we're talking about on the podcast um it's a great subject matter but yeah I've really been uh I've started reading this book blood meridian or I mean I started reading it a while ago but I've really been getting into it and I have a strong feeling that it's going to end up as like probably my favorite book of all time so shout out to that but the subject matter is extremely like disturbing and like violent so be very warned and prepared beforehand if you want to try to read it wow okay but what kind of what is the premise of it um so it's essentially it's a Western so it takes place in like the 1800s and it's about this like kid who joins a gang of uh native american like uh like scalp hunters so in the 1800s like while we were like going into the west and like just taking over the land um america would literally just pay people to like kill native americans and then come back with their scalps as like proof of like how many people they had killed and they would pay for like the scalps so it's um like the story is about this kid joining up with a gang of scalp hunters which is led by this like seven foot this huge seven foot tall hairless mutant who seems to be all knowing and all powerful and kind of wants to essentially just destroy humanity and it's about like essentially like the relationship between like violence and history and morality like how essentially like for america to develop in progress like is it sort of inevitable for like those things to only come about through violence and like in the face of like that sort of violence like essentially like how do you respond morally to a situation against like something and like a group of people like as violent as that like how is it possible to be moral and like is there any even any point in like trying to be moral in the face of that so definitely not the the best thing to have a pre-elemental health depending on what mood you're in but like there are like just like these scenes and like even sentences that are burned into my brain like that are like just some of the most like just i mean first of all like the way he writes a book is um the author of karmic McCarthy he he writes in just this insanely like beautiful way and like that like just a position between the beauty with which he writes about this stuff and just like the violence is just there's so much about it that's like like i just think about like lines like throughout the day because it's that powerful wow no that i mean that sounds very very interesting it's like a thought exercise especially the part you said about like oh do we have to go through these periods of terror and humane like treatment to eventually be better you know like does that have to be this like slow crawl towards progress slow and painful crawl towards progress yeah very it's kind of topical right now too oh yeah very very topical a lot of things there that have like yeah just like in everyday life surprisingly topical just thinking about that watching uh some of the shit going on right now that's amazing i might i might i might pick that up yeah it's again like it's definitely not for the faint of heart like it is like like there's uh there's this uh literary critic Harold Bloom who called it like one of the best books of the century and he had to try three times before he could finish the book because it was just so like overwhelmingly violent that he couldn't continue reading it like it's definitely like i've never read anything like that and but yeah i mean i highly recommend like at least trying you know like yeah yeah for my pick um onto something well that's depressing less than a lot very i'm going to shift gears in a very big way right now it's going to be a hard right turn um or left turn what people say is it right turn left turn left left turn why is it left turn why can't it be right turn that's deep i don't know um going in an orthogonal direction um um i i want to plug this um this this one of this actually one of my friends uh and his dad worked together to create uh a show it's like a it's a sitcom oh shit yeah one of my buddies from UCLA the Vic Menon he he and his dad they worked together and they brought and directed and you know produced with the help of like crowdfunding the uh a sitcom like an Indian centric sitcom of you know this this brown family in the in the Bay Area these group of brown families in the Bay Area and it's just you know i think i think as as a community we've always been underrepresented in media yeah in in Hollywood and not really having the right representation yeah uh and so it's very proud um that you know we're taking the effort to and running these kind of like almost like grassroots campaigns to find um things like this and it it's very enjoyable i i i highly recommend going and watching it's called the new normal i'll plug i'll plug a link in our description yeah but yeah it's called the new normal they've released like i think four episodes they're all on youtube but now i showed i showed my mom my mom loves it i've showed some of my friends and yeah please please go support and and obviously obviously like yeah you can't you can't compare it to like sitcoms that are running on Netflix yeah of course you know big production through big production houses like you can't compare but it is such a great effort um you you can tell that they've put a lot of work into it um yeah and you know we we got to go support and hopefully it gains enough momentum um for them to kind of take something like this to the next level no definitely get it out there and go to yeah yeah what's the youtube channel because i'm trying to search it up but there's a different tv show that's coming up so i want to make sure yeah it's let me find it there is another series called the new normal that i found that issue when i was looking for it too yeah um the new normal indian family how about that aha there it is it's the channel is called evergreen productions okay i see yeah yeah so that's if you just search like the new normal it's not done it's all right it's new normal um and then just say like indian american comedy series like it'll show for sure yeah sweet yeah i'll definitely check it out
