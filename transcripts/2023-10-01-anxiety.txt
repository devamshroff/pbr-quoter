 Do you want to start? No, I mean, you can start. I started last time if you want to go through. Do I want to go through? It's like jumping into the pool, you know, when it's called. That's what it's like. Honestly, that would work for any intro. This is pineapple, more irritation, which is how you've been doing, man. Have all the rest of the all been doing. I'll give some silence so you can talk to us. I'll turn you the recording. That's a good intro. I like it. You just have to, I feel like answering. It's like you just have to lean into the fridge. Yeah, then it becomes funny. Yeah. But we're welcome back. I'm glad you're here. How's life? Life has been a bit of a bit recently. Yeah, just a lot of stuff going on. Like, hey, good times, bad times. A pretty decent mix. Since the last time we talked, we had our birthday party. And like, both of our birthdays are in August. So we just had a joint birthday party. And like, everyone, we know from California, like, for that. So that was obviously amazing. I've seen everyone, like, for the first time in like, for some of them, like, probably like, over a year. It was definitely like nice to see people. But yeah, it's just been like, after that, like, a lot of like work. A lot of like stuff. I've been like catching up on, like, and then I got like sick, like, like, last week, I think. I can't even keep trying to time anymore. And so it was like that kind of like, yeah, that shifted things around a bit. But we're back into steady waters now. And things are looking good. How about for you? Man, it's been, it's been quite a ride, man. Like, since the last time we recorded, I, you know, obviously you mentioned the party we had. That was quite some for context, like, me and a here and another one of our friends here. Then we all have our birthdays around the same time. So we invited, it was like a high school reunion, which is really cool. It was, it was fun. So our entire high school group and a bunch of people in Seattle, we all rented out a boat. And that, that very memorable experience. Other than that, I got lazy. That was a big, that was a big thing for me. Kind of a spur of the moment decision. Yeah, it's, it's been, it's been, it's, it's a different world, man. And having no glasses, it's like, I was, I was telling, I was telling some of my friends, like, this is how you guys live. Like you just get up and you go, I can just get up and go to Safeway and not think about anything else all along the way. Like, this is, this is new. It's nice. It's nice for sure. It's like a weight lifted off of your face. But what else, man? I'm not home currently, but back in California. How's it been being back at home? It's, it's, it's nice. I mean, it's definitely nice. It's, it's a little bit tough at this point in my life. Just because like, we moved out, like kind of outside of the bay. So it's pretty far away from, you know, people. Like from civilization, it's a little bit further out. So for context, for you guys, when I, when I came to his house the last time, like the Uber driver that I took that, because I actually Ubered from San Francisco to his place, which is like an hour and a half away. But once I hit like the city he lives in, like, there were literally paths that, uh, the map was showing that like didn't exist where they were just like road that hadn't been built yet. And by Uber driver, it was like, where the fuck did you bring me, bro? It's like the gas station nearby. I'm gonna run out of fuel. Going through farmland. Yeah. Yeah, literally. Like literally the cow sheds and everything. Yeah. Have you been holding up like emotionally from last time we got? It's been an experience, dude. It's like I've fully been experiencing kind of the wave nature. Yeah. And I've been a little bit more like, okay, my life is starting to make a little bit more sense. Like this is all starting to make sense. Yeah. Quickly. That also goes away. So it's like, yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, it's very, it's very up and down. It's very like my birthday was very, I mean, after, aside from all the like party and stuff we had like on the day of my actual birthday, like that was very emotional. That was like, that was really heavy. I was down that day. That was a, that was an interesting experience for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I did want to, I did want to address the, the last episode that we did. And the support we got from it. That was unreal. Yeah. It was like, it was, it was a very clear first attempt. Yeah. It was, there was some really bad audio that it like cut out randomly in places. I did try to fix some of that. But, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But no, every time everyone I talked to, like loved it so many people envisaged me. And, yeah. I don't know, like, did you expect this kind of response? Like, I'm so shook. Yeah. No, I was about to, I was really about to say, like, I never like, in my like, well, I was just dreaming, kind of expected, this much support. Like, it's also given the context, like, I feel like we've wanted to do something like this, like a podcast or something for so long. And just like, yeah. Finally, like holding ourselves to it, like just being like, fuck it, let's go for it. And then seeing how much it's like resonated with people. And like, yeah. How, like, just seeing, yeah, that kind of feedback. And like, seeing people, like, I've literally had people like, like, I literally had a, like, one of my friends be like, listening to you guys talk, like, made me like, rebook, like, get a appointment with my therapist. Like, to be able to like, catch people like that is like, yeah. Like, it's just such an enormous, like, yeah, it's something I'm so grateful for. Like, yeah. It's incredibly humbling. Me personally, it gives me a big sense of purpose. It's like, wow. Yeah, it's what we're doing here is meaningful in some way. Yeah. I thought so many people text me like, hey, like you put into words, like, a lot of the same things I went to, went to. And perhaps wasn't able to process it like that. Yeah. And so it was, it was really nice to hear. Yeah. Yeah. And honestly, like, it's also proved to me that we are all like, we all kind of go through these things. Yeah. And I feel like we just kind of all have this fear of opening up. And from other people, because we might face judgment or might damage our image in society or things like that. But I think on some level, people are kind of tired of these toxic narratives and polarizing takes that. Definitely. Do nothing but divide us and isolate us, right? Yeah. Hopefully we can grow this. Yeah. No, I'm definitely like, connect with more people. Yeah. Yeah. And I think like what you were saying about like, like seeing how much like it, it's like, like how much people relate to it. Like, I feel like it's very easy to like, I guess like in an abstract way, like tell yourself like, oh, like everyone goes to your hard times. Like other people probably have the same feelings you're feeling. Like it's so easy in the moment, like when those feelings, like have hold of you to like, like just like you can tell yourself that all you want. Like that's not necessarily going to stick or like resonate in the moment. Like it's so easy to like doubt yourself. And to like just see that sort of love. Like when it's like, I mean for me sometimes like it's difficult for me to like open up to people. I'm like very close with and like that I've known for like years. Like being able to see that kind of like support from like other people is just like incredible. It's something that like, I like, yeah, yeah, it's just, this is sounding. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So again, guys, welcome, welcome back to pineapple blunt rotation. And today's topic that we're going to do is anxiety. Yes, this is something that's even more ubiquitous than breakups. And everyone, every single person deals with anxiety. And different forms and different ways and different parts of their life. And it impacts people in many, many, many, many different ways. And I feel like here, I feel like it's like one of those things you don't really make progress on until you realize you have it. Yeah. Definitely. To be honest, me personally, I didn't realize I had anxiety until not too long ago to be honest. Yeah. And I'm very much like on my journey to, yeah. Do they just have just started my journey towards dealing with it. No, yeah, I got you. And it's like a huge thing for anxiety like, like for myself and for like other people, I know like that I've talked to is just like. I feel like anxiety almost gets like. Like it's hard to like distinguish between like where your anxiety stopped and where it just like turns into your personality and the same sense, you know. Yeah, where it's like, like I definitely felt like like there were times in the past where I was like way more introverted and like kept myself and like I almost just saw that as who I was. Like I just saw that like I like to be alone. I like to like do my own thing. And it took me a long time to really realize that like, oh, like. I really do enjoy being around people. I love like talking to people and socializing and things like that. It was just there was so much fear I had associated with it that I didn't even like recognize as fear that like it just yeah, I could just couldn't see it for what it was. Yeah, I think you hit them now on the head. It's anxiety is like it's so like it becomes a part of your core right. Yeah, you don't know if it's just who you are. It's something. Yeah, it's shaping your. Yeah, you know, the lens that you're looking at life through. No, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. It's like where does the line. Where is the line between like I guess like being introverted and like having social situations become exhausting just because like you're so constantly stressed that like afterwards you feel drained. Yeah. So here I know like so many other people like you dealt with anxiety since you know early on in your life and I know you've personally I feel like you are probably the person that has made the most progress and like dealing with and processing it. And so do you want to kind of tell us about like your experience. Yeah, yeah, definitely have a lot of anxiety here. I've had like pretty severe anxiety for like as long as I can remember. Honestly, like even in elementary school, like like I guess it's just like worrying like, oh, are the people I'm friends with like do they really like me? Am I just bothering them by like being around and like I actually remember like, you know, a entry school. I would I don't know if it's every year, but there were a lot of years where I would just like like after the summer sort of just like avoid my old like friend group or like barely like talk to them just because like I don't know like there's just such strong like worry and like fear about like, oh, like we haven't like talked it all like over the summer. And so long like do they even like walk me around anymore and like it's ironic and retrospect because it's like obviously like if I could make friends that easily like every year like finding a new like friend group like people obviously like like me enough to like want to talk to me and like hang out but at the same time it was like, yeah, just like this like constantly like worry like in the back of my head. I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like like stuff like that. And like, I was like dumb shit. And like, I was like, I was like, dumb shit. And like, workshop stuff. But it was just, yeah that like, like, it's like. It's, I mean, it's real, right? It's not dumb shit. It's, it's so real. Same for a kid. That's like your whole world. Right where friends town how you doing school. That's like 80% of your world. Yeah. I was about to say, like, I say I say it's dumb shit, and retrospect that it's almost like who same way I look back at my anxiety and high school and I'm like, oh I'm just gonna rebie you that's the city. anxiety in high school and I'm like, oh, I was so dumb for like worrying about that. But it's like, I mean, that's just the nature of being anxious, right? Like if it was rational, if it wasn't like, I guess like, in retrospect unreasonable, like it wouldn't be anxiety, you know? Yeah, it's not just dumb. So you mentioned when you're talking about the social groups and how you would look for different friend groups after every year, it's kind of like, do you feel like it's like, it's kind of like you need a, like a connection test, like a, like a, like a health check, like, oh, are we good? Like, are we? And if you don't have that, then the immediate, like the default is like, oh, we're not friends. Like, you don't want to talk to me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. It's more, yeah. Yeah. Connection test. Because I know that something like that I've felt before, it's like, it's like, oh, like if I see someone, right? And one time they didn't, like, not at me while I was walking by. And it's like, oh, okay. Then the next time I see them, it's, yeah. I guess we're not friends. I guess we're not nodding at all. Yeah. I just don't know you. I'm just not going to talk to you. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. You kind of hit the nail in the head. Yeah. It's just like given that like time. I guess it's not even just like not reciprocating, but just like in like elementary school, it's not like we like hung out after school and like spent like, hell of time. Like we would have like related and stuff. But it was just like, yeah, I guess not getting that like constant like affirmation about like that we are friends and that we're hanging out. It's almost just like that I assumed like that like my friendships just like telepath or like I would just like let my anxiety like whisper that into my your just such an extent where I just believe like, okay, like like like yeah, I would just like convince myself that they didn't want me around anymore. So yeah. I mean pretty much with you, send. So you mentioned fear, right? Yeah. And so how do you think fear relates to that anxiety? This fear causing anxiety? How do you think about it personally? That is a very interesting question. And it's something that I thought about a lot. I almost see fear as like, fear is almost like an immediate response in like a situation to me. So it's like if you're very like Sam like really worried that like like, oh like and my friends good friends with someone anymore like maybe if we got an argument like I'm like worried like I'm anxious about our friendship like if I'm like walking past them and they don't nod not at me like that instinctive like like reaction in the moment or like if someone like says something that seems to like reinforce an anxiety like for me that I seriously that immediate reaction is fear versus like anxiety has much more to do I guess like with like how I see myself like and how I understand myself like in the world like like yeah so it's the difference between I guess like in the moment being scared for a friendship versus like worrying afterwards or like when I'm on my own like oh like what if I'm this person doesn't actually like want me to be like hanging out with that camera like to be around. Yeah. Yeah I think that's that's fair. That makes sense. And I think go both ways like I think like fear can like obviously like causing anxiety because of something like very scary and stressful happens to you like in like trauma cases right like that obviously like will cause like a lack of trust in the future right like if someone like like attacks you like like then like you're gonna be worried like when you're around people like oh like is this person like gonna try to attack me like like can I like trust this person to like be safer around them like like if you're out of people too like so it's like fear can cause anxiety but then like anxiety like like you will almost like feel your anxiety through the fear causes so it's like an interesting relationship where they both like be each other. Yeah no that that makes a lot of sense. I'm curious like because obviously like as a kid it's really hard to grasp at even the concept of anxiety. Yeah and kind of separate it from yourself right. Yeah I mean it's hard for most people at villages but as a kid it's like there's just I mean you can't even think of that being a possibility. Oh yeah. So I'm curious like what that felt like do you remember what that felt like? Yeah I mean like like obviously like it's there's only like bits and pieces like fragments. Yeah I think it's just like you can't sort of set like like I couldn't separate like how I was feeling almost from like the like it was like like when I worried about like whether or not like friends wanting me around like it wasn't like the idea that like oh you could be feeling this way but like oh like that could be wrong like you need to like I guess like assess the situation and like see how they're like acting around you and like all that like you don't really have a sense for that right it's just sort of you take that feeling for granted and you just sort of like end up projecting it onto the world. So I mean like that is still like what we all do now right like when you're anxious like people are gonna seem like more like hostile to you they're going you're you're gonna read things read into things in a way that reinforces your anxiety. So yeah in a certain sense like it is the same it's just yeah when you don't even have a frame of reference for like what you're going through or like what it like those sorts of like psychological I guess like impacts like yeah it's just you you just assume that's what the world is like and you just take for granted and I mean there was like like what I was talking about with like fear like it wasn't just like projection like there were obviously like things that were like actually like stressful and like actually like scary to me which like just reinforce the anxiety. So I always like talk about this kind of like like I'm I've always been someone who like question things and like thought about the world and like very like I guess like like yeah just like thought about the world and like like just like yeah like question things that other people took for granted. So like the the one example I like to get is like kudis like when like when I was a child like I would like just go up to girls and try to like be friends with them and other kids be like why are you talking to a girl you're gonna have get kudis that I was just like I remember I didn't like like now I can like make obvious like sophisticated arguments about oh yeah no evidence for this what is the theory like established the reality but it was just like like it just seemed so like clear to me that like oh like like why would that be true like what is a kudis like I remember like not being able to really like understand why but just like instinctively like like all I could say was like like oh like what even is a kudis like just like just instinctively to me like the fact that like everyone said kudis were a thing and all of that like didn't change the fact that like I like I just instinctively like questioned it because like I didn't see any reason to believe it because other people did but that like it's not like I mean other kids obviously like can't understand where I'm coming from like I don't want to put yeah like I don't like it's like like it is what it is like I have no like like I have not like fucking spipe all about oh there's fucking six year old making fun of me now but it was like yeah like I would like try to explain like myself and like people would like shadow shadow over me and like laugh at me and stuff and like that like that sort of dispeeds into that feeling right like if like if you like chat like when I'm when people reacting that way it's like that pauses pause me to like that like almost like gay evidence for my anxiety right it almost like feeds like that fire like telling me in the back of my head that like oh people don't actually like you they don't want you around and like the same thing for like um like for teachers like teachers like especially like I mean they don't like their authority being questioned right like I got kicked out of like three free schools like when I was young because like I wouldn't listen to what my teacher said unless they gave me reasons for it like I would just refuse like and like that wasn't even like like there are lots of situations now we're like looking back like I understand like why I should have like done what they said yeah I remember like very vividly being like why should I share things bro I like I want this shit I'm gonna keep it so yeah yeah but it's like just because like no one ever explained to me those things so it's like when like teachers respond to you like that like when your friends like when your peers respond to you like that and then like obviously like I grew up in like a pretty like conservative like brown family and like they also like didn't like they didn't really tolerate like I guess like me like questioning like certain things that they valued or like um questioning certain things that they just said was were true like they just expected to obey like that all kind of like contributed to this like just like background feeling that like okay like I can't like trust the world like and that like so when those were you started coming up it was like like yeah it just gave me an excuse to like believe them and just like yeah fall and fall into that yeah then there's a lot there for sure yeah um but yeah yeah I think right we'd have a field day with me bruh yeah no totally I think but I think like what what you said like on some level like a lot of these things are things that every kid goes through on different levels I think I think well the difference might be like I think what happens is this social there's these social norms that we kind of accept as really like kudis right for example yeah yeah like yeah yeah it's not staked in any sort of reality or there's no like truth to any of it it's just yeah it's just a societal norm I think as a kid it's just um you I mean you could probably argue some aspects of misogyny but um and and I'm sure like some of those arguments are valid but um for a kid it's like if you don't buy into that's the social contracts that we have set up um because you're thinking rationally yeah and in your case like you're thinking hyper rationally right it's like yeah oh unless there is a real reason yeah it doesn't make sense but if you don't buy into it you're kind of you're kind of you're kind of an outcast right yeah yeah not accepted um and I think kids I mean kids learn this then and I feel like it's so interesting because I feel like everyone is kind of initiated into that um yeah because no kid comes out of the womb saying kudis right it's yeah yeah they they they had they bought it at some point because someone made fun of them along the way yeah yeah 100% um so that's anxiety right that's like oh shit yeah I don't want to be different I'm just gonna buy into the social norm no exactly yeah um yeah so that's yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah and especially like yeah go ahead no no you can continue no I'm I was just gonna say this especially like things like um um questioning authority I think yeah it's uh I feel like people teachers a lot of times like don't necessarily do a good job of like explaining why it is the way it is it I think with parents teachers like any form of authority questioning things um beyond and and maybe this is because they don't have the answers to those questions yeah you get met with frustration right oh yeah and the anger and then yeah and then as a kid you don't know how to take that yeah yeah and that just creates this anxiety right like would yeah do you think that that makes sense no no I definitely agree yeah like I think there's a lot like you know what you said like like what you're saying about like parents and teachers like I almost feel like that's where like like I guess like on one hand like there is a genuine aspect where like when we talk about like accepting these like social norms it's like like like there are like genuine limits to like what kids can understand and what they can like learn right like even when I talk about like me like questioning those things like I didn't understand what I was doing right like I didn't understand but oh like there are these like social norms that I'm questioning it was just like this instinctive like reaction that like oh like why would I believe this thing like I know like a lot of people like like just accept like what their parents are saying is like true and like that seems like pretty like like consistent for like most children but at the same but for like someone like me like I just simply remember like my parents telling me about like Hinduism and stuff and when I went to like the temple like I would pray to like every God because yeah I was always like oh like everyone's parents like tell them like stuff like why would my parents be any more correct about like stuff and like anyone else's parents like yeah I think like it like I guess on like one hand like I don't want to like like I think it is like understandable but at the same time like I very much agree with you where um like I think that is reinforced because like like I mean like when they were children like teachers and like some our parents were like treated that way so they see that as like like oh like that's how you just become like socialized like you need to like accept these sorts of things and like yeah um like it's just like also like it's so exhausting to like like it's so much easier to do that versus like explaining every single thing so that makes sense like a lot of what you mentioned was um kind of related to these social norms that were kind of put that are shoved down our threads as we grow up and just told to accept or yeah or or else made fun of you know um then treated like an outcast yeah um and that definitely causes a lot of anxiety yeah um were there were there other things as well that are maybe not related to social um norms um I think like uh I think again like in terms of like work and like schooling anxiety like again like the sort of like I guess like very like high like over achieving like like that sort of like part of brown culture like put a lot of pressure on me like even as like a child like yeah I very much like I think like like yeah like I just internalized that like oh like if everything wasn't done like perfectly like that like there's something wrong and I would be get like so worried about that like I mean like like and like to like bring up another example from later like I have distinct memories once of like um I was saying like in roto Spanish or some shit I had like a 99% because the class was like bullshit right and I remember my parents came into like can't see the conferences and he was like oh what's in my child due to improve and she literally looked at them and she was like he has a 99% bro what are you talking about but yeah I definitely think like there was a lot of like pressure on me um on that side of things and then um again like whether what I was saying from teachers like there were definitely like teachers who like were like less forgiving and like less understanding when you made mistakes like or like they sort of like saw themselves like oh like like they were like saw themselves I guess with as being like oh like like they used like telling it how it is and like being like harsh but in reality it's like I didn't end up like like all that did was make me like more afraid about like opening up about when I had made mistakes and like opening up like like like when I messed things up so yeah I mean definitely like they're definitely other aspects like honestly like I think in a certain sense like they're like like all of like the anxieties I have now like I can see like fragments of them like earlier on like in my childhood like the social anxiety the work anxiety um like yeah just like anxiety perfectionist anxiety yeah perfect perfectionism like insecurity like yeah that's all there and like like it's just like yeah like developments and like changes obviously like as I like understand more about myself like it takes like new forms and like them like as I've like worked to improve myself and like worked to like be better like like I almost feel like like like I'll talk about this more later but I almost feel like as I learn more and as I work on my anxiety it's like it finds new way it's still like hide for me like while I'm trying to like track it down and like trying to like notice like when am I like stressing out over something when I shouldn't be like yeah but at its core like it is fundamentally like the same worries the same insecurities it's just yeah like as I change as a person like your changes along with me yeah so I guess it related to that like so when did when did you um realize that you had anxiety I think for me like it was definitely like pretty late like I think like like because it started so early like um like I like I've talked to people like I've asked other people like the same question um and like a lot of times like they talked to me about like like going to middle school for the first time and like having that anxiety be there in a way that it wasn't when they were elementary school so it like sticks out to them like very like prominently like but I do like for me like when because like it's always been there like as far back as like I think like it took me a long time to recognize that as like not just a part of my personality and not just like who I was like because of like exactly the things I said earlier like thinking that like introversion was a part of my personality and not anxiety yeah like um I think that another big thing is that anxiety is pretty like associated with like other like mental health struggles so like depression was the big one for me like I think there was a lot of like like when I worried so much about like whether other people wanted me around like when I like isolated myself so much and like catch myself like I think like self-hatred like can grow very easily from that ground like it's very easy like if you're constantly insecure like if you're constantly worried like oh am I gonna do well enough like oh like do people actually want me around like it's very easy to turn from do from worrying do people want me around to feeling like a burden right feeling like oh like these may like what if these people don't want me around and so I'm forcing them to hang out with me it's very easy for that to turn for that at least in my case to for that to turn into like self-hatred um yeah I think for a long time like I almost like saw it as more like depression um and so like yeah yeah like it like honestly like I wouldn't say I fully understood like how like deep my anxiety was like until like junior year of college like I think that's when I was like really like during quarantine and like I was alone with myself and I think like that sort of like forced me kind of to like like I don't know like it's like I sort of reached a fracture point where I realized like how much how much weight I was carrying like on my shoulders and like how much was hanging over me and like even at that point like again like there is that part of me that thought it was depression and like I think like it's almost been like like I think I worked like I started off like working on like myself worth and like myself confidence a lot and I think like as I did that I realized it sort of made me realize like how much fear there were actually was describing that and that's when I really started to like understand and like like truly like accept like okay like you like you do have this problem like yeah it's not just who you are like you don't have to be and like you don't want to be that person like you don't need to like think this it feel like this is inevitable or like like use it as an use the fact that that's your personality to like feed into that and like use it as an excuse to avoid things like that's I think when I really started like dealing with it as anxiety is that also around the time when you started therapy yeah I think therapy like yeah therapy is the reason why like and again like I'll talk about this more later but like it was honestly like like changing for me like like again to go from a place where I didn't even realize like how stressed I was like you know like it's like I feel like I felt like I had been like carrying around like a ball and chain my entire life and like I had never like noticed the weight of what I was dragging around and like the sort of like the imprints and like the stars it was leaving on me because like it had just become like so normal and like getting out of that through like therapy like like yeah it's it it was honestly like like changing like yeah that makes sense I mean I'm glad that you're you know you realize when you did and yeah you've kind of enabled the shed some of that weight I think it's I think it's evident like I see it and you and it's like yeah you feel lighter and you feel happier and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I wanted to ask about um you mentioned fear of death um like what what that was like like what what that was for um because I I also I definitely had a fear of death like I think as a child I think I've had it my whole life yeah um and I think it's influenced like a lot of like my just my psychology of like what I need um and so but it wasn't it wasn't like that like it wasn't like I was staying awake at night um terrified that yeah I wouldn't wake up so I wanted to ask about that like what that was like and like how you came out of that yeah honestly that's that's interesting I always thought that like that was something most people like felt later and like but if you also also had that experience um totally yeah I just like I mean I had like you know where in this of like at least an idea of like what death was and like like what I've heard from like other people is like I don't know like like for me it was never that that was wasn't on the table like there was always a part of me that was like just terrified of that idea of just like the fact that I could die and the fact that like I don't know if I can remember if I knew that it wasn't inevitable but yeah I mean I just remember this like profound fear of like losing consciousness forever like I would literally like stay awake at night because I was afraid like it wasn't when I was asleep like I would just never wake up like that idea of just like losing yourself forever and like not even being able to recognize it to a certain extent like like yeah that's just always been terrifying to me yeah that makes a lot of sense I think I my fear of death I guess like now that I think about it a little bit more yeah I guess for me the fear of death mortality was less to do with myself and more to do with everyone around me so that thought that like the thought that like my parents would die one day yeah would that would keep me up yeah that would keep me up at night that would and I don't even know why like yeah I don't know where it came from exactly but that was something that I thought about quite a lot like my parents my friends yeah anyone in my life that I loved just knowing that they would die and I would have to live after that that was that was terrifying um I got you yeah for as long as I can remember and I would think about it at night that I think that was definitely a cause of insomnia for me so yeah I guess fear of death but experienced it in a very different way than you did yeah I mean I think that might have been a part of it for me too I can't remember honestly I just think that like I don't know like even now like if I really think about what it would mean to like die and like lose consciousness forever like that can fucking like send me into a panic like I just think like that feeling of a fear like thinking about myself was like so like just like extremely like strong that it's like burned into my memory like now that now that you've like mentioned that like I pretty sure I also thought about that in terms of like my friends and like people I cared about and yeah but yeah how do you feel like you said you said feel like it's sort of like shaped your life like ever since right like how do you feel like it's done that so I think for myself so I mean now that I said like for myself I it was not a fear it was not a fear of dying but like a fear of growing old I guess so the different I get that has shaped my life a lot and the things that have done this kind of idea of like oh shit life is gonna be over once I hit 30 and I have to do so many things right and so I'd be stressed about like knocking out all the life things that I wanted to do with the adventures and that's why like that that's like a that is like 190% of the reason why I was always on in college and high school I was always like I couldn't sit still like you couldn't you couldn't find me just chilling on any evening like I would be out somewhere seeing something or doing something um yeah no no I mean that makes sense why why 30 specifically like that's like I know but I just had this idea of like the fun times are gonna be over then it's all gonna be responsibilities from that out like yeah I would have in terms of time I would have a good chunk of my life left but because of responsibilities like yeah it's like time to grow up you know yeah and not be fun like that was the idea that I had yeah I do feel very differently about that now and I think over the last couple of years I've really done a lot of work to undo that and yeah I feel like I'm in a much better place with that like you like I don't need to go out like I you'll see me some weekends just showing at home and like yeah staying in and like enjoying it yeah no I think that's I think that's good yeah because like I feel the same way like even now like it's really hard for me to like like even if I'm like at home like I feel like there's always this like urge of like oh like you should be like like thinking about like doing chores around the apartment or like like I mean you seem at yourself like how how often how I sit on the couch and just like watch TV right like just given myself that like set aside time to just like stop like unwind like yeah I've definitely felt the same way yeah it's a skill honestly like yeah yeah yeah I was trying to I've been trying to get back into video games and like I used to play them shits for like six hours a day like I could keep going and that was just like after half an hour I'm like this is yeah I have so many things to do yeah like yeah like listening like being able to listen to yourself yeah and like act on what you're feeling instead of like what you think you should be doing yeah is so hard and like like yeah I mean for me like the turning point was like in my relationship like I realized I was stressing out my partner yeah I don't like I realized I saw like it was stressing out my partner yeah it was like I don't want to why do I want to be this on like I don't yeah and then I quite I started questioning like what is this yeah why is it like this for me because she was good at like listening to herself and when she needed an end day and I would just like if we didn't if we didn't hadn't gone out by like four or five PM on a Saturday like I would get and see I would get frustrated yeah so I so I realized that and that's kind of when I started to question and undo those things yeah yeah yeah yeah give some perspective yeah totally yeah let's go back to the topic though I mean it's related right yeah it is it is it is it is related for sure I was actually gonna say like I feel like one of the biggest things about like anxiety like mentally is like you can you can think like you can tell yourselves like all of like the like logical reasoning you you can about like how it's like irrational to like be that like stressor we're like worried about something and like like you can tie yourself and like like you can tie your thought and not like thinking about that but that's not gonna change the fact that like you're good you're worrying about like that's not gonna make like the worry like go away anymore and like I feel like that can almost feed it sometimes where it's like I use like worrying I use like trying to like think something through as an excuse to almost like dwell on it and just like yeah continuous continue just like going in circles yeah yeah so here um so like how see you mentioned like you remember feeling this anxiety but how did it kind of materialize in your life like how did how did you feel it in what ways you yeah so I think for me one of the biggest parts of anxiety is the physical symptoms and I feel like that's something that's one of the reasons why it took me so long to even realize I was anxious in the first place because it's hard to understand what's going on like like because I feel like those aspects are so like when we talk about anxiety we usually don't focus on those parts because like the explicit worries and fears are like so much like more prominent of an aspect like if you're directly worried about something and you're like constantly thinking about it but at least for me like one of the biggest uh yeah like one of the biggest ways it manifests is like through those physical aspects so like I remember like back in like like even now sometimes but like especially like back in high school I would just like have these like pounding headaches randomly and like I would just like wake up every day and I would just like feel exhausted and I would just like get be so tired and I would like try to load up on caffeine which was not in retrospect the right approach but um yeah like I would just be like so confused on like why I was so fatigued all the time and like to the extent where I thought like oh do I have like apnea or something like maybe I have some sort of like sleep disorder but like to like for something like that like you never even think of that's something like that could be caused by anxiety that kind of like physical exhaustion but when your body is in time to play all the time and it's just like you're constantly worried about things like constantly like um stressed out about like every day life like that kind of like damage just accumulates in your body like without you even yeah I think it like yeah that makes a lot of sense um that's yeah yeah I mean just just to go down the list I guess like uh I also get like like their times where like when I've been really anxious I've had like stark sharp like stomach pains like fucking like stabbing feeling and like like uh just like indigestion things like that yeah like I feel like aspects like that usually aren't emphasized because it's like if you're anxious about something and you start having like a headache or you start like your muscles start feeling sore you start feeling tired like it's so easy to be like oh maybe I didn't sleep well last night because like how do you even distinguish between like oh I was stayed up all night like tossing and turning because I was worrying about something so I didn't sleep well and oh like I'm just like physically so exhausted from like having like that stress like constantly so like that's why I'm like that's why I feel tired right now or like when you have like indigestion it's so easy to be like oh like I must have eaten something bad yesterday like I wasn't like focusing on myself um but yeah like when in reality like their times I feel like terrible and then like I just like it's really hard for me to like get out of bed like I could just feel so exhausted like I'm like struggling to like keep my eyes open and it's like um like I just feel like fatigue throughout the day and then like after I spend some time like like thinking it through where I like get past like whatever I'm like stressed out about like like I suddenly like feel so much better and like I suddenly feel like I have all this energy again and I'm just like yeah like it took me a long time to like recognize the connection between those and I feel like so much of like that physical aspect contributes to the mental part too because it's like if you have like a migraine or if you're having like um like constant like tension tension and fatigue it's like that's gonna impair like how well you can like do like at school or like that's gonna impact like how um yeah how often like you can interact with people and like I'll like yeah like how well you can like articulate yourself and it's like that feeds into the anxiety and it's almost like proof to yourself like oh like how do I trust myself like when I'm like messing all of these things up and like when like you do to a certain extent like perform worse like when you're anxious so yeah yeah I mean that makes sense like you need a lot of energy to kind of do those everyday life things yeah um you know dealing with you know friends and school and family yeah all of those things take like you know some mental capacity and if you're using it all just fighting the anxieties and you know all the stuff that's going on in your head like um yeah and and recovering from those physical manifestations like you're saying like that just that becomes a negative feedback loop and it's just not a good place to be in yeah yeah definitely so have you have you noticed um as you went through the process of understanding that linkage yeah and processing your anxieties have you noticed that those physical manifestations are have gotten less frequent or more mild oh yeah 100% like yeah that's like honestly like I don't know if it's like one of the biggest parts but I would say like a huge part is just like now like like to be honest like I feel like now that I've dealt with my anxiety like when I described it earlier like I felt like I had like a ball in chain like around mind like inble like there is like a real sense in which like just like physically I feel like I have this energy and this lightness that like at like I would only ever have like at like my very best moments like when I wasn't anxious and like like yeah I just feel like so much more rested like I have like like I have like so much fewer headaches like uh yeah yeah I'd have like and it's it's so I don't know it's so strange because like if your body's tense like a lot of times you can tell that it's doing that and but like like if you're like a lot of times like headaches are just cause because we're tensing our jaw or like we're like tensing the muscles in our head um and it's like no even if you know that like that doesn't mean you can control that those muscles that doesn't mean you can stop yourself from like relaxing yeah and it's sort of like part of the process of like like managing anxiety and like getting past it like for me was sort of like being able to accept things like those and like the the negative feelings and then like sort of like like by like mentally like by like handling it mentally and like sort of like reaching a level of like acceptance like that is what you need to do to like sort of like relieve like the physical symptoms yeah that was very at least right no that that makes sense and what you say like would you say like in your view is it are there two kind of aspects to it where it's like the physical manifestations and then is it and then that like is it like a voice in your head that's like saying things that like yeah the mental part is it is it does it feel like a voice in your head yeah it feels like a voice in my head but it feels like my voice like there's no clear distinction where it's like like they're all your thoughts right like yeah yeah it's all a part of you so it's like yeah there definitely is like like almost like at this point sometimes like when I'm like wrestling with my anxiety like it almost like literally feels like I'm just like like there's like of that voice in my head that's like anxious and then it's like I sort of have to like control that or like sometimes I have to like just push it away and be like okay like like sometimes like I can just tell myself like no like that's just exaggerating how bad things are like like just get through myself and sort of like drown out that voice and then other times sometimes like I need to just like shut it off and be like okay like if I try and engage with it like it's just gonna like make the worry worse so I need to just like accept that it's gonna that it's gonna be there and accept that it's obviously shitty that it's there but at the same time like you like there's a level where yeah you just have to accept that that voice is there so sometimes it's kind of like it's like handling it by not handling it yeah right yeah just taking the focus off of it exactly like that's a big part of like meditation like at least from how I understand and like my experiences with like a mindfulness meditation for like anxiety is just like being able to like yeah just like being able to accept that like okay like my mind mine's gonna like wander like my mind like I'm gonna have like all these anxious thoughts I'm gonna have like all of that but at the same time like you like it's like the worry all you want about it or like it's like there's fundamentally like nothing you can do and you just need to be able to like accept it and like divert your attention away from it yeah that makes sense it's kind of like I mean for me when I have those kinds of thoughts and stuff I think there's two things that I've noticed like one is like I tend to when I do have those stuff like catch myself but also like kind of reprimand myself you know what I mean like punish myself for having those thoughts and kind of have this like negative voice in my head it's like you piece of shit like why are you talking about this again no I feel you yeah yeah that's actually that's actually like a thing for in for certain forms of anxiety where you essentially like you feel like or I know different forms of anxiety is a wrong way of saying it but it's sort of like a coping mechanism we're like I do the same thing where like you sort of like beat yourself up or about like thinking something that's like irrational or like having like an anxious thought because like there's that other part of you that like knows that it's irrational and like knows that there's nothing to worry about but like and like it's like I think like that's a huge part of like getting past like mental illness in general is just having that kind of grace and just like for being able to like forgive yourself for those things instead of like beating yourself up but yeah that's there's actually even research that shows that like that idea of of thought suppression actually causes like those things that those thoughts that you're worried about to get worse like the more you try and repress to them like the more like significance you're almost giving them in your mind right versus like if you just have the thought and you're like oh like it's it's just like a past like taboo right yeah exactly so you're there's a special place in your head for things like that yeah and it's like yeah like there is like an aspect where it's almost like obsessive where it's like you there's this like urge like compulsion to like just like stop yourself that like just feeds into it and like again like that that's not easy like it's a lot easier said than to done some type of like stop yourself from doing that like especially when you're already like so mentally and physically exhausted from the anxiety itself but yeah totally um no love I mean it's a kind of goes back to like just the concept of loving yourself right like understanding where you are and treating yourself like you would treat your best friend kind of situation yeah no that's actually a yeah I have this uh um like in therapy like they gave me this workbook called the mindful self compassion workbook and I honestly recommend it to like anyone who's like struggles with that but um yeah it's exactly about that idea where like the in order to like the biggest thing you have to do to like like or the most helpful thing you can do is to just like love yourself and like like and I feel like as someone like who's anxious like I had always like like that idea of like self love it's so easy to like tear it apart and like oh like that's like narcissistic like what like I don't need to like love myself like I care about myself like things like that but like yeah just being able to like you said like love yourself like you love a friend like it's not about like giving yourself like like letting yourself get away with anything or something like that like it's just about genuinely treating yourself with like the same compassion that you would give to someone that you love where it's like like you wouldn't like like beat up someone you who you care about who was like feeling shitty or like yeah like I'm being up like even with like even if they like hurt you in some way like you're not gonna like just like lash out and like yell at them and like make them feel like terrible about themselves so why do that to yourself you know like yeah you can go and say that it's okay you know yeah it'd be okay yeah and it's like a like it's literally like when it started like I almost had to like imagine like like like I almost had to feel like I almost felt like I was talking to myself like yeah being like oh like you don't have to worry about this like there's nothing wrong like it's okay like like you did your best but yeah and it feels so awkward like especially as someone who is so used to like just just like instinctively like just lashing out at myself and like like just being aggressive and being like oh like I want to like like oh like I'm so like stupid for doing that like I want to destroy that part of me that's like responsible for like all of my flaws and all of my weaknesses but in reality like that's not healthy like it's the same way that like real anger is when it's directed at a person right like yeah if like someone doesn't acknowledge that they hurt you like all your anger is gonna do is like damage yourself and it's like you like the first step on that path is being able to like let go and being able to like forgive yeah no I'm I'm I'm on that journey the guy I'm trying to love myself more um treat myself better and in that way instead of like having a very negative reaction towards myself yeah yeah I got you so I will have to check that out yeah that that book that you recommend what was it called uh mindful self-compassion workbook okay yeah and I'm gonna write that down yeah yeah no I highly recommend it yeah like it's it's not like a hard read or anything like it's not very straightforward and like when I started reading it like I remember I was like a few pages in and like even like getting past the intro like shit had me like tearing up like like I remember like the intro to the book like the author is straight up like there are like they raise a child with like autism and like they talk about like they're just like openly about like like obviously you're gonna have that resentment there's gonna be a part of you that like when they're throwing a tantrum and like the grocery aisle is like so like angry at them and like like just like like like they even talk like openly about like like things that are like it's it's almost hard for me to say like even though I'm not the one with it but like they talk about like wish like wishing they had like a child that wasn't like that like having like a normal child but you need to be able to like accept those thoughts to understand like yeah like just being able to see someone else do that like to a thought that's like so damaging but at the same time like I totally understand where they're coming from right I can give you that empathy so like why not give that same empathy to myself like yeah yeah that that book is like yeah amazing that makes sense I yeah people picked this book it feels life changing definitely not okay link in the description so does it ever get like does it ever get like randomly really bad like it was before oh 100% okay so there are still days where it's like oh god like why am I here again yeah okay definitely and like that's like another big thing you need to get over or not get over I mean you like that's the thing with all of this right like there's never gonna be a moment where you're perfect there's never gonna be a moment you don't like that you'll never lash out at yourself again that you'll never like be hurtful towards yourself and you'll never like worry about something that in retrospect seems so stupid and you tell yourself like oh like I like I worried like I've dealt with that like thought so many times in the past like why did I like given to it this time like yeah like backsliding like like you're that that part like that the anxiety it like that's honestly like one of the most difficult things to accept about like mental illness is to accept that like yes like this this is like an illness like this is something that I'm going to have to like deal with for the rest of like the rest of my life but it that doesn't mean that it doesn't get better like that doesn't mean that like every day isn't easier and like those days when it is like really bad like it's so much easier to like cope with it and to like like like sometimes it's really bad and like I can like throughout the day like remind myself and like just like use some of those like techniques I picked up in therapy to like bring my anxiety down to a regular level and then other times I can't but at the same time like I can stick grounded in the fact that like this this feeling is just temporary yeah and I think like that's one of the biggest things I had to get that's like one of the biggest hurdles like when you really start seeing yourself approving in therapy is like just feeling so amazing and feeling so good about yourself and then having that all crash back down like it almost feels like even worse because like you're getting past some of those unhealthy coping mechanisms like you like again like you feel so good for so long that like going back to like that place like you're just like is like with that all a fluke like am I going to be here forever again like yeah yeah like it getting over that is definitely a struggle that makes sense I've heard that before the concept of that your anxieties and kind of these unhealthy coping mechanisms and stuff like that like they stay with you it's not that like you become magically like free of them they stay with you you learn how to manage them and they in turn get less frequent and your life as a whole improves yeah and it's not just like yeah oh sorry were you saying something no I was saying like it did that did that fact that that's how that's what the reality is did that discourage you in the beginning because because I've noticed that it has discouraged me it's like that fact kind of makes me sad yeah to like knowing that the things that I'm dealing with now I will probably be dealing with them forever yeah right yeah in some way so it feels like oh god like yeah yeah I just I wish I could just be free of all this you know like like if if if I can never be free of all this like why am I working so hard towards oh yeah you know bettering myself because it's tough yeah it's hard to work on yourself and keep it takes so much mental effort to do those things yeah no that yeah like that's a like a huge part of it you feel like you've been struggling so hard to like push this bowler up a hill and then to watch it just fucking tumble back down and like like fucking break apart you know wall and fall apart into pieces is like yeah it's heartbreaking yeah are we supposed to keep doing it like is it supposed like every time you like is that just a law like I'd like I'm just trying to understand how to think about these things you know like I mean is it like are we like morally compelled to do that like no that that's a thing is that like like how but it's every time you do that it gets a little bit easier to roll the water up the hill the next time and like like you overall like the general trend is like downwards like it's not just that like it's less frequent like my anxiety definitely is like like also less intense that it was like back when I like before I started therapy yeah but it is definitely like yeah pretty disheartening like especially like when I first went to therapy like I was just so uncomfortable like especially like talking about some of those topics so with someone you don't know that well like it's so like it's so easy to like get in your thoughts about like feeling judged and then it's like when things don't go well like I wouldn't say that that's something that like consciously like like I didn't think that about it in terms of where it's like oh like what's the like oh if it's just gonna come back what's the point but for me like I guess that's like a high-speed train I thought let me let me rephrase that um it's more like it's for me it was more like this hopelessness of like oh like like am I I'm never gonna get better like a lot of confidence in myself more than anything but it that's just like a different manifestation of the same feeling fundamentally you know of like putting in that much effort seeing it all crashed down and just like daring your hands up and being yeah like what's what's the use like yeah no that's definitely like actually like I've been in therapy for like I think like more than three years at this point and like for that first like year like maybe in like year and a half like there were like months I didn't go to therapy because like I would just like be like oh what's the point like it was so uncomfortable like I would just avoid it without even like really like understanding why and like yeah it's like finally at a point now where like I go in like consistently like every week but even that like that's not something that's easy and like that's not something that necessarily comes natural like I know a lot of people who like got disheartened like first of all this for fucking process just to find someone that you clicked with right like I've been right with so many like shitty therapists that have just made me feel worse and it's like even when you find someone who clicks with you like it's inherently like uncomfortable and like right it's like you like every time you go you have to consciously make the decision right like there's no one that's gonna force you to like go to therapy like every like you just need to like like yeah like it's so hard sometimes to like tell yourself that and like it's literally the gym yeah the mental gym dude uh the force yourself to do it yeah be and go in there and be uncomfortable no 100 percent like I very much do consider it like very similar to like like like physical activities like going to the gym and like exercising like I often think about it like like it's like the techniques you pick up from like therapy are like it's like form like that you pick up like while swimming it's like you can't like like there's nothing anyone can like tell you like there aren't like particular beliefs that you learn or anything like that that you can just like sort of like get from a book and like understand it's almost just like learning these mental techniques to like relax yourself and like building up that mental strength to be able to like deal with those thoughts like yeah like I very much consider like like that mental part like yeah like almost like a physical like activity I mean okay this is I've been wanting to bring this up but like isn't it crazy that we don't teach kids this these things oh like 100 isn't it like isn't it it bog goes my mind just thinking about the fact that we don't teach a kid yeah how to deal with anger oh yeah how to deal with sadness yeah or jealousy or like any of these feelings that are like not happy and happiness and joy yeah right like we don't teach a kid how to deal with these things or at home yeah and it's like of course and then we wonder why people need therapy yeah of course we need therapy like yeah because when these feelings start yeah we have no clue how to deal with them yeah not at all yeah not yeah how does that make sense yeah I mean that's the uh it's like it's like weird to think about but like all of this a lot of this stuff is like so recent right like we we we we still barely understand how the mind works like how to like regulate yourself like emotionally like yeah like it's yeah like there there's so much to learn yeah sorry I don't know but I don't even think it's that complicated right like I think a lot of these things people have known for hundreds of years um I'm not talking about like the complexities of anxiety and stuff like that but just simple things like hey when you feel anger you need to channel it the right what yeah like when you feel frustration like you talk about your feelings you don't I mean I guess like I guess I just you teach people like you teach kids like yeah you don't hit yeah I feel like they don't really explain why you don't hit people like and like what to do instead I mean I feel left considering what I said earlier yeah yeah yeah no it's definitely like I think there is like almost like they're still like like they're like parents who are like oh like I don't want like schools like intruding on how I like teach my children and like yeah like you said like there is like definitely a tiny bit of that and like how you teach children like yeah but it's definitely like insane that yeah like it's not more like normalized and it's not like more like common yeah anger's one thing bro but sadness sadness is like I feel like the only response I've heard to sadness is don't be sad just don't be sad don't be sad and don't um don't cry like I've heard that so many times yeah don't cry where are you crying unhappy right yeah I mean that's unhealthy and I think the public view on that is changing like yeah yeah people are more okay with people crying especially like guys crying and like little boys crying and stuff but yeah in general like we still don't tell kids that it's okay to be sad you know and like yeah definitely like what you're feeling is natural and yeah yeah so that it doesn't turn into something like anger right because that's what turns into anger it's why the hell am I sad let me go punch something yeah right like this thing is responsible for me feeling bad so yeah because I mean it's so it's so much like it's so much like like it feels so much better to be angry then to be like in real like grief like yeah it's so much harder to like truly like accept like that kind of pain and like weakness like I'm said this yeah I definitely agree um and I think that's like a like I almost feel like that's part of the reason why is the fact that like we see those as like bad emotions are like negative emotions and like yeah inherently they are right like no one wants to be like sad but at the same so I almost feel like uh it's like it's almost like what we what I was saying with like or what we were talking about with the thought suppression where it's like we it's like instinctively we want to tell people like oh just like don't ignore those like thoughts like the negative things and it's like almost like what people want to do in everyday life to a certain extent is just like like a lot of times avoid their problems avoid like dealing with it like directly and I think that's where like those unhealthy coping mechanisms come from too right like when you have those feelings inside when you have like sometimes like guilt and shame about even having those feelings in the first place because no one's ever told you like oh this is natural to feel like oh like this is healthy like this is okay like yeah everyone's gonna like have these feelings sometimes like you just like want to like you don't have any like healthy way to like engage with those feelings it's just like yeah you get angry because like someone makes you feel sad so you're like okay I'm just gonna like express this to like stop myself and like like hurt this thing that I don't that I feel like is responsible for my sadness yeah because like it's sort of like you're hoping that will make it go away when in the reality like that's not like all that's gonna do is like make the pain worse expression of that actually motion is like is key right like just just be how you're feeling and it's like and it won't fester like it won't fester like you like people don't embrace the negative yeah just like you said they don't embrace this so-called negative feelings yeah um this kind of like tying two things together though we talked about already but there's a show on Netflix called midnight gospel right oh yeah we've seen a few episodes so so the last episode of that series and for those who don't know midnight gospel is a it's it's actually a podcast called the Duncan Trussle family hour and they've taken like snippets of that and turned it into a show and like overlays and animations on it is really really good I highly recommend it but the last episode of that series like is kind of an interview of Duncan with his mom who has cancer and she's dying it's terminal and so he interviews her and he's just so mad he's so mad at the world because he's so sad that his mom is dying right and so they so they so he's like he's like really mad he's like in there's mom's like just being like hey Duncan it's okay like it's okay like everyone's time comes like you know all of these things right like you I'll always be with you like like all of these things right and he's just mad and he's unable to kind of come to terms with there right he's like what am I supposed to do when you're God yeah what am I supposed to do and she's like you're supposed to cry you're supposed to feel that grief yeah and like cry I feel like people like another thing I've heard is like when when when people are sad or anxious or like any of these things like meditate right like meditate as in like meditations at the answer to not feel that anymore yeah right yeah this is like this like crazy idea of some dude who like isn't fazed by any of these things and these big life things like oh a breakup or a person dying or like any any sad thing happening I think the idea is not that that sad thing won't evoke sadness inside you anymore right like you're supposed to feel those things yeah no definitely like that's that's that seems like that's the only way to process it that's the only way to move forward and still be whole yeah it's almost like yeah like I feel like culturally like let's go again but it's like that idea of being like collected in all situations like the idea of like being emotional is like seen as a bad thing when like in reality like if someone you care about dies and like you didn't react with sadness like yeah that's like so like that's like that is so unhealthy like if I felt if I met someone like that like there's no reason for us to like feel that way but yeah we all just need to kind of internalize this idea of like to embrace your sadness you know and be okay with it and like cherish it and not push it away yeah yeah it's actually like like I don't know if you want to include this or not getting a little philosophical here but uh there's like a theory that essentially the reason why uh that is like such a thing like culturally is like so like back in like the ancient Greeks like there were a lot of like thinkers who felt like being in touch with their emotions was a good thing and like um like aerosol talks about how like like the like ideal like person is someone who's like can feel their emotions and can engage with them but at the same time like isn't like controlled by them like obviously like isn't like just driven to do like random like do anything like in response to their emotions and it's like almost like as like like Christianity and like forms of religion like came up there was more and more this idea that like oh like the mind is like pure and superior but like the body and like emotion is like something bad and like the more rational like the further you can get away from like your feelings the more like like the closer you'll get to the truth into like what's like rationality and like yeah yeah like yeah like just like like perfection so it's like I almost feel like it's an extension of like that idea where it's like emotions are seen as something like toxic something that's like hovering up like the truth about the world or like the truth about ourselves when in reality like yeah our feelings are like how we engage with the world the things that like draw us back to the world and like make us the most interested in like the most focused on the things we care about so yeah otherwise like it just be like being a machine right yeah exactly like like what even is the point then at that point yeah like you're literally just doing everything by like logical axioms yeah yeah and where the hell did this thing about men being rational come came from like a yeah men being rational and women acting on feelings like I you like that that has not been true in my experience like the some of the most irrational the people that I see are oh yeah that's the thing it's like people say that shit but everyone who says that says that is not emotionless it's just the only emotion they'll ever express as an anger because they told themselves that it's bad to be emotional but they just can't piss down anything for cousin open so coming back to anxiety how is it so how's it now like do you think does it impact your day-to-day yeah I mean it still definitely impacts like my day it is like even right now like I'm definitely like anxious like I especially like when we first started like I was having like jaw pain and like a bit of a headache just from like like sort of like clenching my jaw and like I am on pull so that's also another reason why I'm really anxious sure obviously like dealing with with this like like it's like still like uncomfortable to like engage with these feelings directly sometimes and like yeah like it's still something that like impacts my daily life it's just again like it's just less and it's like I went and even when it does impact my life like I remember in the past like there were times where like like when I was starting to deal with my anxiety it's like my anxiety would be so overwhelming that it was like I would almost like use that as an excuse for like avoid situations I was anxious about because like yeah I would start getting like this massive headache like I would start feeling like tense and like now that I almost knew those are symptoms of the anxiety like I would use that like as a like you reason to avoid like situations and like now like I'm much like better able to ground myself and be like okay like you know you're anxious about this but like once you get into it like you're gonna enjoy your time I see like you're gonna be able I'm gonna be able to like do like the things that I want to do and it's like even if like I'm not at a hundred percent like yeah I can like like I'm definitely like self-conscious about right now but like oh am I like as articulate as I was like earlier and like oh am I like not explaining myself like properly and I'm is the way I'm like talking like choppy like the way I'm talking is like probably choppy than it was earlier but I'm able to like just settle that part of my mind and be like all you can do is like try your best and it's like right if I don't like if I use that as an excuse to avoid like things like this like all it's gonna do is make it even harder the next time and yeah like by like by choosing to do it anyways by like directly engaging with it like that I know like next time it'll be a little easier and like like again like it's so much easier to tell myself that because I can look back at the past and like look back at where I was when I started and like now it's like so clear where that like how much I've improved and like how much like better like things are yeah that's so you kind of cope with it by like just talking through it with yourself yeah like like hey this is what's going on like literally okay yeah because that's a thing like to let sounds yeah yeah like I feel like especially for me like I'm pretty like introspective like I'm always like thinking about like like thinking about how I'm feeling and like thinking about like my thoughts and like my beliefs and all of that and like I actually put off like therapy for a while because I was always like oh like I already like think about like like my thoughts and stuff yeah what's the point like what is it there if it's gonna be able to like help me with but at the same time like yeah like you never realized like how much like you're overlooking and like how much like like these like it's not even that you're like lying to yourself or you're like telling yourself anything that's wrong but it's almost like you just don't like recognize like like you just don't realize something or you don't realize like the real reason you're doing something and yeah a lot of um and even like I remember in the past like there were times where I could tell like I was anxious about something but it was almost like I couldn't stop myself from acting on it like I couldn't stop myself from like worrying and like getting in my head and like yeah just being able to like like just taking like the effort to like stop yourself and just explicitly like say to yourself in your head like you know this is gonna be fine like you know like there's not actually nothing wrong like you know like these thoughts you're having like aren't like reasonable like just like taking that time to talk to yourself like that like yeah it's like it's like developing that kind of inner voice yeah like that's hard that's not just you're not just born with that is like you have to develop that over time yeah yeah and kind of a kind of a layer above those like that train of you know the train of thoughts that's normally in your head oh yeah yeah yeah I almost feel like sometimes it's not like a voice over necessarily like sometimes it's like like a voice it's almost like the anxiety is a fog and like that part of you that like knows like what's actually going on is like underneath that fog and it's like hard to recognize it sometimes so it's like being able to to like listen to that voice in the back of your head like yeah beneath all of that noise like right and bringing that voice into the forefront so you can tell yourself explicitly like no it's okay like yeah this is just like some star warship bro literally like that's a thing like it's lucky insane to like to think about life yeah that's cool that that makes sense so one one question I had is and you may have like over like when you were younger before you kind of started processing this stuff yeah you may have like developed some like unhealthy coping mechanisms right because you don't know any better how was it a separate process to kind of let those might those unhealthy coping mechanisms by themselves go or did they just like or did you just not turn to them anymore oh but you realize what was going on yeah it's a mixture of the two but I'd say like primarily it's the first like you need to like directly engage with them because yeah like with unhealthy coping mechanisms like what makes them unhealthy is the fact that like they drive you to do things that like let you deal with your anxiety in the moment and maybe let you deal with like the most important things in your life that like you have to deal with like work and stuff where it's like you need to do that have to survive but at the same time like it's those mechanisms are going to be damaging like in other parts of your life and so like instinctively like without even like realizing that they're unhealthy you're just going to react in that way and it's like to be able to like a big part of it is being able to see that clearly to like give it like to realize that as something significant and like directly like challenge that parts part of you that wants to do that because like I mean for me like a big thing was like I remember like I like I it would make me like I would get so anxious about how people saw me that like I wouldn't tell anyone like anything about how I was feeling like I wouldn't like never express like how I was feeling emotionally because I just felt like oh like I don't like it was like I just didn't want to have to worry about it I didn't want to have to worry about like what people would think and like worrying about like oh are they going to think I'm weird am I going to be oversharing like all of that like it was just better to like keep that to myself like it would it would even hard be hard for me sometimes to just be like oh like I feel exhausted like I need to take some time to myself like something as simple as that felt like so like like was so nerve-wracking and it's like being like it was like a huge process to like get over that and like be like okay they're going to be times now where like I overshare right like say some dumb shit because like obviously like I'm not used to that like I don't have that kind of practice I haven't built up built up like that mental skill so yeah like it that definitely is a huge part of the process and I would say like honestly like that's that's one of like the biggest parts like of the process at first and if like biggest in the right way but I'd say like one of the most significant parts is like just being able to like like those mechanisms just end up feeling like home to you like they're just where you're comfortable they're just like they've just become your second nature and being able to take that step away like like you're gonna have your anxiety screaming in your head like the entire time telling you like no like this is wrong like what are you doing like like yeah like it's like it's it's definitely like hardest but like even now right like there are times where I like just resort to those and like I just don't have like the energy that they to like engage with those thoughts and I just end up like going back to those like unhealthy gubbing mechanisms and like another thing is like those unhealthy mechanisms sometimes like like it's like with what I was saying about like avoiding like sharing how I was feeling it's like there is a genuine sense in which you are like exposed to less danger if you expose if you don't express yourself right like you'll never have a risk of anyone like laughing at your how you're feeling or you never have a risk of anyone judging you like if you continue doing that like if I continue sticking to that coping mechanism so like there's almost that part of you that's like oh like isn't it better than like yeah yeah like like so like even getting past that like being able to recognize like like yes I'm taking on more risk but I'm never gonna be happy with like the life that I'm living unless like I accept that risk like yeah I definitely think that's like a huge part that that makes a lot of sense it's it's a it's a it's kind of like it's a battle on many yeah on many fronts right it's like it's being played in many different places yeah in your head that's like one of the biggest parts I would say like now like before my anxiety is taken is like like yeah I almost consider like guerrilla warfare where it's like my like my anxiety like it feels like it changes like from time to time where it's like I'll deal with it in one way and then like they'll like the anxiety will come back like in a different part of my life and like maybe like now like physically like I'm tensing my body more and like I'm like tensing a part of my body that I like didn't used to tense before like I remember at one point like I would just like tense like my feet just like grow up and like I won't even realize what I was doing and then I'd be like oh shit like I'm doing this other thing and it's just like the anxiety is just like continuously like morphing and like taking on like like trying to hide from your conscious awareness and it's like like and it's like again like it's so easy to like be disheartened and be like fuck like it like what's the point if like it's just gonna it's always is it always gonna be as bad just in different way like keeping that perspective that like no like even if it continues changing like I can deal with it so much better now like even if it's really bad yeah I can still like live my life like to so much more of an extent that I want to and also like like the new ways that it manifests like they do decrease in intensity over time like yeah it's like it's new it's a new struggle every day but like the struggle both get like the struggle definitely gets better over time like there's a there's a bojack quote that's always like resonated with me it's I don't even remember like I did not finish I never finished watching bojack yeah I haven't watched it so long ago but it's just like the quote is like let me just fucking pull it up I can watch it but is it the dude that runs the runner dude that like randomly shows up in like outside his house I don't like I don't know like they're really like wise quote possible like yeah I don't know if I even saw it in the show or whether like yeah someone like my student the bojack like reminded me but yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like really something that like like has resonated with me and it's like hard to keep in perspective is it gets easier every day gets a little easier but you got to do it every day that's the hard part yeah like yeah like that's really like the biggest thing to like like it's to realize like it's not even about like how well you like fight it but it's about like taking that effort every day like there's like even on like my good days like there are times like I have like like my anxiety is gone really bad and like thinking back I realized like I was having a good day but there was like a kernel of it like in the back of my mind and like I didn't pay attention to it because I was feeling so good and I didn't want to engage with it like I didn't like realize what was happening and I was like so like focused on like everything else and like that seed just like grows and grows until it like turns back into like really bad anxiety and like again like like then like if you it feels like so pointless again and it feels like okay like even if it gets better like I'm starting back at like ground zero but yeah like yeah you did like that's really the hardest part like just like you know how to cut it earlier yeah you got to kill it earlier yeah and it dies faster it dies faster with less resistance yeah like I'd say like now like even when my anxiety is like at its worst like it like it's hard but like I can get it get back to like a good place like and here I'm like like like like real like when it gets really bad like yeah can take me like two or three days but like I'll get back to a good place and it's like before that used to take like weeks and weeks sometimes and like even when I got back to a good place like it was nowhere near as good as it is now right well I I've learned a lot like about my own anxiety just by listening to you you know I'm talking about it with you um and I'm sure a lot of others will have realized something or the other or at least related to something that you've said today yeah hopefully man yeah thank you for doing this this is yeah like being vulnerable like this not easy yeah but I think a lot of people yeah I know I have gotten a lot out of it no no no it's good to hear that I'm back yeah no because I think like yeah like like this stuff is so difficult and it's so difficult to even like like it's so easy to dismiss yourself like and like the path like you have to walk is like so long sometimes like like I don't know like I just genuinely like I have like so much gratitude towards like all the people in my life who have been there for me like even if sometimes like without realizing like for my therapist for like like like a lot of this like comes from him like his perspective like too like like helping me like think through like all of that like that's genuinely like I just want to like be able to give some of that back like some of like the love that I've been given because like and like some of like the perspective that I've like gained because like yeah like I couldn't have gone here without like the perspective of others yeah a share perspective right and help each other overcome and heal yeah like I've definitely like had conversations with like friends who've gone through therapy it's like it's like we're sharing like things we've learned we're at like some times I like pick up like new things from them like comparing notes yeah yeah you're doing what oh uh compare the symptoms checklist boys yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because it's also like like you said like I have like so much anxiety like still about like opening up about how I feel and like carrying my perspective and like like yeah like like it's like I feel like a lot of times like that anxiety prevents me from like it's like I almost feel like oh like how like I sort of like leads me to dismiss myself I think because of that like yeah it just prevents me from like helping others sometimes when it's like yeah and I want to just be able to give that back so we had some responses from the question that you asked and so I want to make sure we touch on that well one of the responses is um anxiety can be good sometimes it lets you know that you need to make changes see I almost feel like that's like I used to feel the same way but like more and more like I feel like that's kind of like just a coping mechanism like yeah where I would like use situations where like my anxiety like told me something was wrong and I'd be like oh look like my anxiety helped me like like I need to like keep it around like even now like I do that to a certain extent where like I'll like worry about something and keep worrying about it almost as a way of like reminding myself that that thing is important but in reality it's like you can do the same thing in much more healthy ways like you can still like like just because you're not worrying about something doesn't mean that it's important to you and doesn't mean that it's like significant and like a big part of like for me like what I had to get over was being able to like untie those wires in my head where like I almost equated like being anxious about something as like caring about it and as it like remembering like or remembering like something that like I have to like deal with there like a problem that I have to solve so I don't know like I personally feel like anything you can get out of anxiety you can get out of healthier means right yeah if like I'm worried about how I see them in social situations and maybe sometimes like I do actually talk over people like and like my anxiety is what reminds me like oh I shouldn't talk over people like you can at the same time just like think to yourself like okay like I know it would feel bad like to other people like if I talked over them and like I can just like try reminding myself of that and like even in retrospect like if I realized like like again like getting back to what we were saying where it's like maybe at first it's worse than when I like worried about that and maybe it's like harder for me to stop myself but like I just have to continue like working on that and like eventually it gets to a place where like I can do the same things like and still like keep on top of like the things I care about without needing that anxiety yeah I think if it gets to the anxiety point the point where it's turned into anxiety then it's by nature it's unhealthy like it's like if it's gone to that point there's something wrong yeah yeah yeah okay and then the other stuff we've addressed already the only question is ever unnecessarily give yourself anxiety attacks because you jump to the worst case scenario oh 100% yeah that's like I do that too for sure I mean that's like I don't I don't know what it is we we all like extreme worst case scenarios oh yeah like it's like we need in general like people yeah I feel like it's like kind of romanticized oh yeah and that I mean that's why you see these things in books and yeah movies and stuff things are never really that extreme yeah I mean extremes are significant so yeah it makes sense that we'd be like interested in them in some sense but yeah I mean that doesn't it's very rare right but like human brains are the same way it's like yeah yeah go ahead I know what were you saying no you go ahead what was I saying bro okay I was saying oh no I was gonna say okay I remember yeah so it's like that's why like books and movies are usually about extreme extremes and not like every day right because yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like oh I'm gonna go to the gym at five today like that should ain't interested right yeah totally yeah yeah what were you saying the human brain no I was just saying like the human brain seems similar in the sense that it also like jumping to extreme conclusions oh yeah definitely yeah I don't know I was just trying to answer the question yeah but um yeah I think I'm like part of it at least for me was um like it was almost like like I see like anxiety it's very much like tied to like an insecurity about myself and like um like sort of like not not like having trust in myself to like be able to do the things that I want and like yeah like just not having that sort of trust in myself like and then I feel like when I like fixate on like those sorts of like extreme scenarios like it's almost out of this feeling of like like some like it is always like I don't know it's like like they're like every day like when we cross the street like it's possible that like we'll be hit by a car right and it's like to a certain extent like it's unavoidable like there are times when like that things are gonna happen and like like you can't control that and it's like terrible and it's like scary but like like I definitely like feel like that's something you need like or I've had to work on for like getting over my anxiety is like being able to accept things like those right it's definitely a struggle but I think there's a lot to that one like I think there's a lot of different reasons we think about yeah yeah the streams so totally yeah just to throw a another one out there I guess like I feel like a like another thing is like if like like say you like um it's like if you feel like you like a lot of times like we feel like we need things like maybe I'm like worried about like losing something because I'm like oh like if I lose my phone like I'm not gonna be able to contact anyone like how am I gonna get home like all this stuff like like that is almost like itself like a form of insecurity where it's like we don't trust ourselves to be able to deal with like these sorts of like situations like I don't I'm phrasing it very poorly but it's like we're worried about the worst happening because we don't truly believe that we'll be able to deal with the worst if it comes when right part of part of that is just having that confidence in yourself to be like like I like even if the worst comes like all I can do is like the best that I can yeah that's not something that's in my control yeah there's a whole yeah there's a lot to be said about um specifically that yeah like like accepting things that are outside of your control yeah and just like dealing with what you can't that's that's a whole yeah that's a whole episode yeah so I wanted to say like again like I know we kind of touched on this at the start of the episode but we really appreciate everyone listening and and again like trying to reiterate the goal here is that the point is we're not mental health experts we're just we're just two people trying to share experiences and what we've learned and share that and kind of start discussions and so hopefully we find we're trying to figure out how to engage with you guys the audience better and kind of get some something some

movie or a you know a piece of like a painting or something like any art yeah that's speaking to you so if you guys have any ideas for the name for something like that please please let us know wait I was gonna say I kind of like I just got hit with an idea yeah yeah kind of pretentious but what about culture corner culture corner bro that feels like no no no I had to say it it's not for it's not pretentious it feels like I'm in like fourth graders yeah this is a culture corner and it's just like it's just like you know people bringing in art from the different cultures like different porth posters yeah you ever made that a show for like show-in tell like oh like I'm gonna do Diwali and like someone else gonna do holy and oh yeah and the like Christmas and stuff like that oh yeah bro that that she was weird for us we actually had this thing we're like every I don't even remember how often it was but every now then they're just they just be like we have an assembly and we have the auditorium and they hit us down on the auditorium stage like black curtains around us and all sides they just like bring out a random piece of art and this is the style of this work of art this is this artist it was not like an official class we never got a grade for it it was just like every now and then they're just like we're culturing you bitch I think your principal just had an obsession yeah educators are quirky you know oh yeah I feel like you kind of have to be quirky to be an educator so yeah do hold a bullshit a whole generation of kids in one area we'll just end up learning something about something completely random because that dude just had that quirk yeah it's like there's like hundreds of like the singers who like look her up like learning some bullshit yeah yeah definitely had some interesting teachers that was like in my brain totally dude I had to teach her once that like literally became obsessed with Twilight when Twilight came out as they know she literally like was gone for a week and we had like a sub for that week and like it finally came out that she had been gone at a Twilight convention damn and I think she ended up getting fired or something I don't know because she oh wow yeah that's that's I really watched Twilight in that classroom room wow yeah um it was wild damn are we gonna is this is this podcast is this gonna be like an easter egg like every every episode we're gonna find a way to shit on Twilight uh we did we did we did through what tide yeah I feel like it's not an easter egg bro this pretty fucking like straight up we're gonna lose our all our Twilight fans hey those those movies are so bad it's good bro yeah that is true it is it is pretty funny and it gave us Robert Pence and it's all that matters yeah so anyways for for the pick of the episode culture corner we'll call it culture corner for today culture corner here uh what have you brought to show it now moving boxes are in my culture corner right now because I'm gonna stick with the song for mine my song of the week is called The Night We Met by Lord Hiran it's a very poetic song and it's like got this like old time you feel to it too yeah I like it so that's my pick old time you like how I think he's just got this like kind of voice that belongs in the 60s or something you know yeah just in that way what I don't know like what I don't even know how to just is that is it's like acoustic like country like it's not really country it's not country at all actually it's what the what is the genre let me let me find it Lord Hiran Shana American Indy Rock Band okay okay yeah got you yeah I've been getting back into like more and more rock music so yeah um I guess for me yeah I let's just keep it to a song um I guess uh mine would be a song that I was just listening to before recording this podcast um the microphones in 2020 um it's it's kind of a wild song um it's like it's um that one song is the entire album and it's a 40 minute long song so like it it's yeah it's a wild wild journey but um it's essentially like the singer like reflecting on his entire life since like childhood and it's like sort of framed where it's like like you know how when you think about the past like if you're going through photos it's like you're sort of just like have these random memories like that just come up like as you're looking at like old mementos like sometimes it's from like your childhood sometimes it's from like when you were in middle school like just like random points of your life so it's sort of like him like going back to the house that he grew up in and like going through like those old things and like sort of just like describing these like random memories that led him to like become a musician in the first place and sort of like describing like his like thought process like his perspective now versus then like how he's changed as a person and like it's the reason it's that long is because like that's how life is right there's no like breaks are like stops in life it's just like one continuous like just stream of like experiences and like sensations so yeah it's it's really be like it's one of the most like like their passages in that song that are like some of the most beautiful like music I've ever heard and I think like just lyrically like it's also just like really fucking good like like genuine like poetry thanks everyone for tuning in appreciate it always thank you guys and um we will see you in a few weeks with yes the next episode which I don't think we know what we're gonna do
